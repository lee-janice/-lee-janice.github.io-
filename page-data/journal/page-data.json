But even in my mindlessness, I happened to lock eyes with a girl leaning up against the backrest of a park bench.\nTight black coils bounced from her head, and a fitted army-green top with short sleeves and loose black jeans dressed her small frame.\nWith her left hand and a bent elbow she held a up a smoking joint.\nWhen our gazes met, a slight smile bloomed on her lips, her free hand shot up into the air, and she gave me a tiny yet eager wave.\nAlthough small, her gesture was imbued with the intimacy of a dear…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/17/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 17th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-17","date":"2022-04-17","lastupdated":"2022-05-08","topics":["journal"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I was walking from the Christopher Street station to the gym this morning when I came across a parade of children being chaparoned to school by their parents.\nI began to daydream about being their age, if only for a day, if for nothing else than to relinquish myself of the overbearing weight of self-knowledge and consciousness.\nLiving in oblivion sounded quite appealing at the time.\nBut in a moment of clarity and foresightedness, I caught my wistful thinking as it was tumbling towards self-indulgence: I thought of a scenario in which, in twenty years time, I may very well be crossing the path of someone my own age (a ripe twenty-two) on the street.\nWhat if I were to think in that moment, “I wish I could be that age once more, to enjoy the frivolousness and levity that accompanies young adulthood”?\nHow foolish would I be then?\nBetter not to wist, and to instead wist. A conundrum that I am contemplating today is the problem of habituation with respect to eating food.\nIt’s an unfortunate…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/14/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 14th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-14; youth and longing; habituation; tasting life; attention; a dissonant existence","date":"2022-04-14","lastupdated":"2022-05-06","topics":["journal","youth","habituation","attention","cognitive dissonance","alice in wonderland"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I had a strange dream last night. Well, in actuality, it was a multitude of dreams, but this particular one disturbed me.\nI only recall a single grotesque fragment of it. Someone was cooking a gargantuan purple fish on a gas stove.\nIts jaundiced, bulging eyes protruded from its head and its body was covered in yellowed spikes.\nMost nauseatingly, its mouth was stuffed with tentacles, colored with the same purple hue and littered with the same spikes as were on the rest of the body.\nThe person cooking the fish looked at me and then grabbed ahold of the tentacles and twisted them loose from the fish’s mouth.\nHe said, “Here, I know you like this part” (of the fish) and laid the writhing mass on my plate.\nThat was all I remember. But when I woke up, I was extremely repulsed. I have my suspicions regarding the origin of this dream in my subconscious, which is why I decided to record it.\nEarlier this week, I bought some oxtails to make my favorite Korean comfort dish: ggori-gomtang.\nI don’t…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/13/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 13th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-13; a dream; guilt about eating meat","date":"2022-04-13","lastupdated":"2022-04-13","topics":["journal","dreams"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I wonder if birds ever feel despair as us humans do. Do they experience loneliness? Is there ever a moment in a bird’s lifetime when they feel outcast by their fellow feathered folk and they can’t find a single thing — nary a single branch — in this world to lean or rest upon? What do they do in those moments? How do they go on? Or are they contented with searching the skies for yet another seed to peck at? This notion sounds ridiculous, but I wonder if our experiences (birds, humans) are more similar than one may initially imagine. This morning, I saw a female sparrow (well, they aren’t really sparrows, but I’ve forgotten the correct name for them) nip at the feathers of a male, vying for his attention. A bird’s equivalent of flirtatious pursuit, I presume. It made me dream about the microcosm of the bird’s love life — on their scale, are there gestures as subtle as a blush, a stolen glance, or a light caress on another’s shoulders? Do they exist, only to be imperceptible to the naïve…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 10th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-10; a bird's love life; cognition; a slight descent into madness","date":"2022-04-10","lastupdated":"2022-04-10","topics":["journal","cognition","loneliness","uncertainty"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I find my thoughts racing, resulting in my inability to sleep. I’m thinking about my Crisis: At the core of the event was the realization that I had built my life on a bed of sand, and it crumbled when the tides of uncertainty came rushing in. I think that I gave myself electroshock therapy, which sounds insane to write out, but it truly felt as if my nervous system was being reprogrammed: I felt shocks down my legs and arms and the nerve endings at the tips of my thumb and index finger turned black. Sensory stimulus afterwards, especially sounds and music, felt as though I was experiencing them for the first time. As a result, a depressive fog that has loomed over me for years and years was lifted. In the months leading up to the climactic event, I had incessant feelings of “strangeness” — something was amiss. I knew certain concepts and themes were important (e.g. Gödel’s incompleteness theorems) and was attracted to them, but I just couldn’t connect the dots. I’d try to write about…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/03/05/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"March 5th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-03-05; thoughts on the Crisis; thinking about thoughts; For the Good Times","date":"2022-03-05","lastupdated":"2022-03-05","topics":["journal","the Crisis","cognition","for the good times"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Signed the lease for my NYC apartment today!\nThings are moving so fast, but I’m really grateful that everything is working out so well.\nMy flight is next Wednesday, and I can hardly believe it! Finished reading A Wind in the Door recently.\nI’m trying to revisit books that meant a lot to me as a kid. “No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally - and often far more - worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.”  — C.S. Lewis  And in revisiting this book, I’ve realized how much it probably influenced me and my general worldview.\nFor example, a recurring concept in the book is the relativity of size: the protagonists visit organelles smaller than mitochondria and observe phenomena on the scale of galaxies.\nBut in each of these experiences, there are the same principles and patterns that repeat themselves across time and space.\nThe hierarchy in A Wind in the Door goes: farandolae → mitochondria → human → planet → galaxy → universe.\nIt reminds me of my Crisis…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/14/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"October 14th 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-10-14; A Wind in the Door; relativity; interconnectivity","date":"2021-10-14","lastupdated":"2021-10-14","topics":["journal","life update","childhood","the Crisis","interconnectivity"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Found a roommate, and we’re looking at apartments in Central Harlem — the one we’re applying to is amazingly beautiful.\nIncredibly high ceilings, which I feel like is rare for New York, tons of light, a community garden across the street (!), I’m very excited! Went to the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells with my mom this past weekend.\nBeing in the stands amongst the crowd is so much more exhilarating than watching on the television.\nFor some reason, I had the preconception that tennis was a “stuffy” sport live — I had the mental image of heads swiveling to the left and right in complete silence so as not to disturb the flow of the players.\nBut in reality, the crowd is invigorating.\nThere were cries of joy, uncontainable gasps of shock (when Andy Murray won via an underhand serve to take the first game of the second set!), and cheers of encouragement being sent towards the players.\nIt reminded me of the oneness of humanity and the emergent powers of camaraderie.

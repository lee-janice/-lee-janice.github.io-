A conundrum that I am contemplating today is the problem of habituation with respect to eating food.\nIt’s an unfortunate…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/14/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 14th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-14; youth and longing; habituation; tasting life; attention; a dissonant existence","date":"2022-04-14","lastupdated":"2022-05-06","topics":["journal","youth","habituation","attention","cognitive dissonance","alice in wonderland"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I had a strange dream last night. Well, in actuality, it was a multitude of dreams, but this particular one disturbed me.\nI only recall a single grotesque fragment of it. Someone was cooking a gargantuan purple fish on a gas stove.\nIts jaundiced, bulging eyes protruded from its head and its body was covered in yellowed spikes.\nMost nauseatingly, its mouth was stuffed with tentacles, colored with the same purple hue and littered with the same spikes as were on the rest of the body.\nThe person cooking the fish looked at me and then grabbed ahold of the tentacles and twisted them loose from the fish’s mouth.\nHe said, “Here, I know you like this part” (of the fish) and laid the writhing mass on my plate.\nThat was all I remember. But when I woke up, I was extremely repulsed. I have my suspicions regarding the origin of this dream in my subconscious, which is why I decided to record it.\nEarlier this week, I bought some oxtails to make my favorite Korean comfort dish: ggori-gomtang.\nI don’t…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/13/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 13th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-13; a dream; guilt about eating meat","date":"2022-04-13","lastupdated":"2022-04-13","topics":["journal","dreams"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I wonder if birds ever feel despair as us humans do. Do they experience loneliness? Is there ever a moment in a bird’s lifetime when they feel outcast by their fellow feathered folk and they can’t find a single thing — nary a single branch — in this world to lean or rest upon? What do they do in those moments? How do they go on? Or are they contented with searching the skies for yet another seed to peck at? This notion sounds ridiculous, but I wonder if our experiences (birds, humans) are more similar than one may initially imagine. This morning, I saw a female sparrow (well, they aren’t really sparrows, but I’ve forgotten the correct name for them) nip at the feathers of a male, vying for his attention. A bird’s equivalent of flirtatious pursuit, I presume. It made me dream about the microcosm of the bird’s love life — on their scale, are there gestures as subtle as a blush, a stolen glance, or a light caress on another’s shoulders? Do they exist, only to be imperceptible to the naïve…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 10th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-10; a bird's love life; cognition; a slight descent into madness","date":"2022-04-10","lastupdated":"2022-04-10","topics":["journal","cognition","loneliness","uncertainty"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"year":"2022","month":"04","dirRegexByYearAndMonth":"/journal/2022/04/"}},

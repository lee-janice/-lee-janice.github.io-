No one can do it for us. The mystical tradition is very much a Sophia tradition. It is about tasting and trusting experience, before institution or dogma. <footer> — Matthew Fox, an American priest and theologian </footer></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<p>A continuation of the theme in the previous section that I've been thinking about recently is the importance of attention, especially in the current cultural moment.\nI was thinking today about the phrase <em>time is money</em> and how that isn't truly accurate — I'd suggest that the idiom should instead be <em>attention is money</em>.\nOne's time is fickle, and its \"value\" is reliant on the way that one chooses to utilize it.\nYou could have all the time in the world, and spend it in a way that would be equivalent to you having not had it at all.\nMore time is not, of its own accord, immediately more valuable.</p>\n<p>I would offer that attention, on the other hand, does possess this characteristic: more attention is more \"valuable.\"\nAttention is the means by which one can compress or expand time: have attention not, and your time slips away between your fingers.\nHave attention, and your time, and what you do with it, extends to greater lengths.\nThe value of attention is no secret to those seeking profits, as evidenced by the existence of a multi-billion (if not trillion) dollar industry that capitalizes off of setting the most tantalizing and inescapable traps for capturing people's gaze.</p>\n<p>The importance of attention — the centrality of it to the human project — is why I'm very scared of apps like TikTok.\nTikTok is a black hole in this respect, sucking in all that orbit around it and never letting them go.\nIt's a really masterful mechanism of vivo-thievery that operates (literally) right under our noses.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Another feeling that I'm struggling with recently (there seems to be an endless stream of such things) is how strange it is to be so dissonant in mind — to have parts of me that feel so serious, so somber, and yet in the very next second, to feel unbridled joy, to relish in the sun and heat and the spring breeze.\nI feel so hopeless, yet I cannot help but to feel a levity as I taste the flowers dancing on the fringes of the air — a fragrance so delicate that you fear that if you breathed in a moment too long or too harsh it would fade away as lightly as it had come — and I feel so unhappy, yet I recall a memory that makes the gremlin in my mind laugh, and it boils over into my face in the form of a strained smile and a furrowed brow, as almost to relay the guilt of betraying my sorrows.\nMy being aches like a terribly fragmented soul strung out and contorted in all sorts of strange directions.\nHow would it feel to be harmonious at last?\nThat feeling must be what they call inner peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yet another object of my contemplation (will there be no end to these thoughts!) is how in order to do anything in this life, one needs to have some level of \"suspension of disbelief:\" to act, you must to believe in <em>something</em>, if not in yourself.\nTake this too far, and you risk submerging yourself in ego, rigidity, and dogma.\nBut not partake in it at all, and you get stuck in an endless cycle of doubt, self-correction, and perfectionism.\nIt seems like there is a \"sweet spot\" between certainty and uncertainty (perhaps an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_chaos\">edge of chaos</a>?) where healthy thought and action lies, but it is (in my experience) extremely difficult to balance yourself there.\nIt reminds me of Hofstader's <code>MIU</code> modes for dealing with formal systems that he introduces (along with the famed <code>MIU</code> system) in the first chapter of <em>Gödel, Esher, Bach</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>M</code>-mode = <em>Mechanical mode</em></li>\n<li><code>I</code>-mode = <em>Intelligent mode</em></li>\n<li><code>U</code>-mode = <em>Un-mode</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To my understanding or interpretation, mechanical mode is the doing, whereas intelligent mode is the self-reflection, evaluation, and meta-cognition.\nAnd as Hofstader points out in a later chapter (not in reference specifically to these modes, but in a more general sense), humans cannot seem to operate in multiple modes at a time, like how we can either listen to one melody in a piece of music or the whole thing in its entirety, but we cannot seem to listen to both one part and the whole at once.\nIn a similar fashion, it seems incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to operate in <code>M</code>-mode and <code>I</code>-mode simultaneously.\nI suggest that one needs to first operate under a reasonable degree of certainty — <em>a.k.a.</em> operate in <code>M</code>-mode — and then switch into <code>I</code>-mode once the task is finished.\nThis suggestion seems to be quite obvious, but I took this roundabout way of explaining it to justify to myself the reasons why I should stop self-correcting and worrying about things to the extent that I get nothing done.\nI think I try to operate in simultaneous <code>MI</code>-mode too often, and it inhibits the process of my doing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'll finish this long-winded entry off with an account of an experience that tinged the rest of my afternoon with a slight sourness.\nAfter work, I stopped by a local used bookstore on Mercer Street.\nI was duly intent on purchasing a copy of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, which I had never read as a child.\nTo my elation, I found an attractive copy on the shelves and ushered it with eagerness and haste to the register.\nWhen I handed it over to the shopkeeper, he peered at it with a façade of slight disdain, and asked, \"Where did you find this? ...was it in the kids' section... or in fiction?\"\nI managed to stammer across a reply that conveyed that it was in the fiction section (I wasn't even aware of a kids' section in the store!), and hastily carried Alice and myself away from the premises.</p>\n<p>Upon reflection, it could very well be the case that he did not mean to insinuate anything with his question.\nBut I'm one to be very sensitive to tones and non-verbal language, and his demeanor oozed with the drippings of judgement.\nI'm not happy with how sensitive I am to such things: it's useful to be this way in some cases, but sometimes I perceive condemnation and disapproval where there is none or become too afflicted by it when it is misplaced.\nSo what if I <em>did</em> find it in the kids' section!\nTo hell with literary elitism! Judgement begone! I am in the mood for whimsy and wonder.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-me\">Perhaps this is more a testament to my poor eating habits than to the pitfalls of sensory habituation.<a href=\"#fnref-me\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"April 14th, 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-14; youth and longing; habituation; tasting life; attention; a dissonant existence","date":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["journal","youth","habituation","attention","cognitive dissonance","alice in wonderland"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/14/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/13/"},"frontmatter":{"topics":["journal","dreams"],"title":"April 13th, 2022","layout":"post","published":true,"booknote":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/notes/lectures/sapolosky-robert-human-behavioral-biology/"},"frontmatter":{"topics":["notes","lectures","biology","evolution"],"title":"Sapolosky, Robert; Human Behavioral Biology","layout":"post","published":true,"booknote":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

trust me in that she looked effortlessly cool.</span>\nWhen our gazes met, a slight smile bloomed on her lips, her free hand shot up into the air, and she gave me a tiny yet eager wave.\nAlthough small, her gesture was imbued with the intimacy of a dear friend, not the hesitancy of a stranger.</p>\n<p>My bumbling brain didn’t know how to process this.\nShe couldn’t possibly be waving so familiarly at <em>me</em>!\nI looked around myself incredulously, searching for the true recipient of the message.\nThroughout my confusion, however, she maintained eye contact and when I at last pointed in disbelief at myself, she nodded and persisted with her greeting.\nUpon receiving this affirmation, I broke into a grin and returned the wave with joy.\nAt this point, I had already made my way past where she was sitting, and I unfortunately lost her in my sights.\nThis short encounter filled my then-melancholic heart with gold<label for=\"sd-i-would-consider\" class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\"></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"sd-i-would-consider\" class=\"margin-toggle\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">I would consider this event to fall into the category of one of the things that I'm very fond of: \"spontaneous expressions of love between strangers who will never see each other again,\" although \"love\" in this case may be a tad strong.</span>, but when I turned the memory over in my mind later that day I regretted my timidity — I wish I had said something to her, or at the very least that I had done something to have made a stronger connection in that moment.\nI wish I were more bold.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I had another provoking encounter yesterday at Union Square Park.\nI had just bought eight bundles of daffodils from a stand at the farmer’s market (their fragrance was divine), and I plopped onto a park bench in contentment with my purchase.\nWithin a few moments of me finding my rest, a scraggly-haired man dragged a Citi bike laboriously to the bench on my left and made his seat there.\nHe had the appearance of a wanderer: a lanky frame, a long and sun-weathered face, and craggly yellow teeth.\nI don’t mean this statement in jest, but something in his demeanor evoked that of a mouse or rat-like creature.</p>\n<p>He sat there, gazing off into the distance with a thousand-mile stare reflecting through his semi-opaque, cerulean sunglasses.\nAfter a couple of contemplative minutes, he looked my way and stated matter-of-factly, but with a slight drawl, “Those’re some beautiful flowers.”\nI laughed and readily agreed, and told him that I had bought them just over there, right off the corner.\nIn the conversation that transpired between us after this initiation, I began to suspect that something of great consequence was arresting his mind: it was almost as if he was attempting to convince himself of some weighty fact and as if he were talking more to a reflection of himself than to me.</p>\n<p><em>Those flowers, they’re beautiful, get some water, get some plant food, nurse them back to health… It’s a shame that they won’t last, I hope you can make them last.</em>\n<em>Y’know, they make these synthetic flowers these days that stay perfect forever, they’re beautiful and they put them in houses, as decoration.</em>\nBut then: <em>Maybe it’s okay that these aren’t gonna be perfect forever, they fade, and that’s a fact of life… but I hope you can make them last.</em></p>\n<p>While he poured out his concerns to me, I nodded enthusiastically in agreement, especially to his last point.\nI promised him that I’ll do my best to take care of the flowers, and not soon after, I hoisted myself up from the bench to make my way home.\nOn my commute, I had time to nurse on his words and found myself wondering if this encounter was not some sort of premonition: I began to realize that so much of my mental anguish, if not all of it, is provoked by a wretched fear of impermanence and my hopeless — yet unquenchable — desire for something eternal and everlasting.\nIs this antithetical to life, to beauty, to truth?\nIf I persist in this lust, this almost-Promethean pursuit, will I be fated to a life of eternal wandering and a never-ending search for that which does not exist?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"April 17th, 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-17; two encounters; impermanence

Carlos Alcaraz in Stadium 2.\nIt was an especially hot day, and the tournament organizers provided everyone with handheld fans to cool themselves down.\nI was observing the crowd across the stadium, with many of them fanning themselves.\nWhile I was watching them, I \"zoomed-out\" my eyeballs, which is a process that I sometimes partake in that I'll explain in greater detail in another post, but essentially it amounts to switching the context or attention of one's perception from singular objects to one's whole field of vision.\nIn doing so, the crowd across the way turned into one cohesive whole, with the flicking of its fans reminding me of the intricate ticking of some gigantic clockwork, or of the pulsating of an organism, or of blades of grass dancing with the blowing of the wind.\nIt was another reminder of oneness for me.</p>\n<p>The final thought I had was when I was walking to our seats in Stadium 2.\nI made a point to try to be more aware of all of the people walking by and to take note of their behaviors.\nBut the crowd was like a swarm -- there were so many faces, noises, sounds, smells -- and I got the same feeling of overwhelming sensory stimulation as I had in LA State Historic Park during the peak of my Crisis, when everything sounded like it was booming and echoing in my ears.\nThe feeling only lasted for a couple of seconds, but it made me appreciate how much filtering of input and information that our brains do for us on a daily basis.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Rene (my downstairs neighbor) has a beautiful cat (gold, blue/green/yellow eyes, leopard spots), which I've intermittently seen roaming the halls.\nSometimes the cat meows right outside my door, I open my door and try to coax him over to pet him, but he leaps away skittishly.\nBut this time was different.\nHe meowed, I opened my door, and he came right in.\nHe explored and looped around every inch of my apartment.\nI got on all fours and explored with him, and he started purring!\nI wonder why he chose this day to come inside.\nMaybe he knew I was leaving soon and he wanted to get a peek before all of my stuff was gone.\nWho knows!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"October 12th, 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-10-12; BNP Paribas Open; zooming out; oneness of humanity","date":"2021-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2021-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["journal","tennis","zooming out","the Crisis","oneness"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/12/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/notes/personal/content-consumption-queue/"},"frontmatter":{"topics":["notes"],"title":"Content consumption queue","layout":"post","published":true,"booknote":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/14/"},"frontmatter":{"topics":["journal","life update","childhood","the Crisis","interconnectivity"],"title":"October 14th, 2021","layout":"post","published":true,"booknote":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

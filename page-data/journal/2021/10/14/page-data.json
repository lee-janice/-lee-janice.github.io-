Finished reading A Wind in the Door recently.\nI’m trying to revisit books that meant a lot to me as a kid. “No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally - and often far more - worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.”  — C.S.

The shuttle’s interior looked like an airplane’s, and I took a window seat. As soon as I sat down, the shuttle took off. It shrunk down to less than the size of an atom.

To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of history… .

Everyone matters.

I think it captures the oneness of the illusory dualistic nature of many things - that which can be glorious is also that which can be horrifying. I think the concept of awe captures this well.</span> They are both of Germanic origin, though.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"October 14th 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-10-14; A Wind in the Door; relativity; interconnectivity","date":"2021-10-14","lastupdated":"2021-10-14","topics":["journal","life update","childhood","the Crisis","interconnectivity"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/14/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/12/"},"frontmatter":{"topics":["journal","tennis","zooming out","oneness"],"title":"October 12th 2021"}},"next":null}},

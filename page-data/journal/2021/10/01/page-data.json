while on a drive, and it reminded me very strongly of the institution of the court in K.'s trial.\nHere are some of the lyrics:</p>\n<pre><code>Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous\nPublicly perpetrating that \"In God We Trust\"\nCross-examined by a master manipulator\nThe faster intimidator\nReceiving the judge's favor\nDeceiving sabers doing injury to they neighbors\nFor status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers\nSee the bailiff\nRepresenting security\nHolding the word of God soliciting perjury\nThe prosecution\nPolitical prostitution\nThe more money you pay.. the further away solution\nLegal actors\nBabylon's benefactors\nMasquerading as the agency for the clients\nHypocritical giants\nMorally non-compliant\nOrally armed to do bodily harm\nPolluted, recruited and suited judicial charm\nAnd the defense isn't making any sense\nFaking the confidence of escaping the consequence\nThat a defendant is depending on the system\nTotally void of judgment purposely made to twist em'\nEmotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen\nFramed by intentions\nInventions whereby they lynch men\nEnter the false witness slandering the accused\nPlanting the seed openly showing he's being used\nTo discredit, edit, headed for the alleged\nSmearing the individual fearing the unsuspected\nExpert witness (the paid authority)\nMade a priority to deceive the majority\nOf disinterested peers\nDodging duty for years\nHating the process\nwaiting to be returning to their careers\nDo we expect the system made for the elect\nTo possibly judge correct?\nProperly serve and protect?\nMaterially corrupt\nSpiritually amuck\nOblivious to the cause\nProsperously bankrupt\nBlind leading the blind\nGuilty never defined\nFilthy as swine\nA generation purin it's own mind\nLegal extortion\nBlown out of proportion\nIn vein deceit\nThe truth is obsolete\nOnly two positions:\nVictimizer or Victim\nBoth end up in destruction trusting this crooked system\nMafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma trying to own a piece\nof the \"American Corona\"\nThe Revolving Door\nInsanity every floor\nSkyscraping, paper chasing\nWhat are we working for?\nEmpty traditions\nReaching social positions\nTeaching ambition to support the family superstition?\nWhen the Son of Podition is Commander in Chief\nThe standard is Thief\nBrethren can we candidly speak?\nWoe to the men\nTrusted in the chariots dem'\nLeaning on horses\nThey run their intellectual sources\nCounterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom\nConfusion consumes them\nEvery word they speak it turns them out really white\nInternally they absent of light\ntrapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night\nUnder the curse\nEvil men waxing more worse\nFaxing the first\nAngelic being cast to the earth\nIt's time for rebirth\nBurnin' up the branch and the root\nThe empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit\nTurning me ill\nLet him who stole, no longer steal\nOh it's real\nSurrender for Jehovah is real\nHow long will you sleep\nTroubled by the thoughts that YOU keep\nThe idols YOU heap\nCausing the destruction you reap\nJudgment has come\nFind it and return to the One\nAbandon the flesh\nSelf-interest: Broadway to death\nPride and the Greed\nHide and subdividing the seed\nThe knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie\nCaused us to die\nLet your emotions be crucified\nRenounce all your thoughts\nRepent and let your mind be re-taught\nYou'll find what you soughtwas based on the deception you bought\nA perception of naught\nWhere the majority remains caught\n</code></pre>\n<p>Jesus, if this is not masterful lyricism, then I don't know what is.\nSome versus that strike me as particularly relevant to <em>The Trial</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The more money

This billboard FORCES you to look at it, since it extends halfway across the freakin' street.\nHow is this legal? This is one of those LED/digital billboards that have been popping up everywhere as of late.

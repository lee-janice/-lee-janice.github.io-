He exists freely in the\nfullness of his whole being. The flow of his consciousness is not the\nfixed repetitive patterns of our usual self-centered consciousness, but\nrather arises spontaneously and naturally from the actual\ncircumstances of the present. … But in the end it is not the extraordinariness\nof the teacher which perplexes, intrigues, and deepens the student, it is the\nteacher’s utter ordinariness. Because he is just himself, he is a mirror\nfor his students. When we are with him we feel our own strengths\nand shortcomings without any sense of praise or criticism from him.\nIn his presence we see our original face, and the extraordinariness\nwe see is only our own true nature. When we learn to let our own\nnature free, the boundaries between master and student disappear in\na deep flow of being and joy in the unfolding of Buddha mind.</p>\n</blockquote><h3 id=\"prologue-beginners-mind\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#prologue-beginners-mind\" aria-label=\"prologue beginners mind permalink\" class=\"no-tufte-underline before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Prologue: Beginner’s Mind</h3><ul>\n<li>Practicing Zen is difficult because it is hard to keep the mind and practice pure.</li>\n<li>The goal of practice is to keep our beginner’s mind.</li>\n<li>The most important thing is not to be dualistic—the “original mind” contains everything in itself.</li>\n<li>If your mind remains empty and ready, it is open to everything.</li>\n<li>In the beginner’s mind, there is no self-centered thought of “I have attained something.”</li>\n<li>The beginner’s mind is the mind of compassion.</li>\n<li>There is no need to have a deep understanding of Zen—you have to read each sentence with a fresh mind.

It does not\nseem to come down swiftly, as you might expect; it seems to come\ndown very slowly because of the distance. And the water does not\ncome down as one stream, but is separated into many tiny streams.\nFrom a distance it looks like a curtain. And I thought it must be a\nvery difficult experience for each drop of water to come down from\nthe top of such a high mountain. It takes time, you know, a long time,\nfor the water finally to reach the bottom of the waterfall. And it\nseems to me that our human life may be like this. We have many\ndifficult experiences in our life. But at the same time, I thought, the\nwater was not originally separated, but was one whole river. Only\nwhen it is separated does it have some difficulty in falling. It is as if\nthe water does not have any feeling when it is one whole river. Only\nwhen separated into many drops can it begin to have or to express\nsome feeling. When we see one whole river we do not feel the living\nactivity of the water, but when we dip a part of the water into a\ndipper, we experience some feeling of the water, and we also feel the\nvalue of the person who uses the water. Feeling ourselves and the\nwater in this way, we cannot use it in just a material way. It is a living\nthing.</p>\n<p>Before we were born we had no feeling; we were one with the\nuniverse. This is called “mind-only,” or “essence of mind,” or “big\nmind.” After we are separated by birth from this oneness, as the\nwater falling from the waterfall is separated by the wind and rocks,\nthen we have feeling. You have difficulty because you have feeling.\nYou attach to the feeling you have without knowing just how this\nkind of feeling is created. When you do not realize that you are one\nwith the river, or one with the universe, you have fear. Whether it is\nseparated into drops or not, water is water. Our life and death are the\nsame thing. When we realize this fact we have no fear of death\nanymore, and we have no actual difficulty in our life.</p>\n<p>When the water returns to its original oneness with the river, it no\nlonger has any individual feeling to it; it resumes its own nature, and\nfinds composure. How very glad the water must be to come back to\nthe original river! If this is so, what feeling will we have when we die?\nI think we are like the water in the dipper. We will have composure\nthen, perfect composure. It may be too perfect for us, just now,\nbecause we are so much attached to our own feeling, to our\nindividual existence. For us, just now, we have some fear of death,\nbut after we resume our true original nature, there is Nirvana. That is\nwhy we say, “To attain Nirvana is to pass away.” “To pass away” is\nnot a very adequate expression. Perhaps “to pass on,” or “to go on,”\nor “to join” would be better. Will you try to find some better\nexpression for death? When you find it, you will have quite a new\ninterpretation of your life. It will be like my experience when I saw\nthe water in the big waterfall. Imagine! It was 1,430 feet high!</p>\n</blockquote><h3 id=\"part-3-right-understanding\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#part-3-right-understanding\" aria-label=\"part 3 right understanding permalink\" class=\"no-tufte-underline before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Part 3: Right Understanding</h3><h4 id=\"traditional-zen-spirit\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#traditional-zen-spirit\" aria-label=\"traditional zen spirit permalink\" class=\"no-tufte-underline before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Traditional Zen Spirit</h4><ul>\n<li>According to the Buddhist understanding, human nature is without ego.

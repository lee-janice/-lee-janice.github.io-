T.) Suzuki (1870-1966) brought Zen to the West (with a focus on satori, or enlightenment), and fifty years later, Shunryū Suzuki (1904-1971) did similarly, but with less focus on satori. On preparing his students for his death, he said: If when I die, the moment I’m dying, if I suffer that is all\nright, you know; that is suffering Buddha. No confusion\nin it. Maybe everyone will struggle because of the physical\nagony or spiritual agony, too. But that is all right, that is\nnot a problem. We should be very grateful to have a\nlimited body…like mine, or like yours. If you had a\nlimitless life it would be a real problem for you. Introduction Zen mind is a phrase used by teachers to invoke the purpose of Zen in their students: “to make you wonder and to answer that wondering with the deepest expression of your own nature.”\nTo practice Zen mind is beginner’s mind (shoshin), or the “innocence of the first inquiry—what am I”?\nThe beginner’s mind is…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/essays/spirituality/suzuki-shunryu-zen-mind-beginners-mind/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Suzuki, Shunryū; Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind (1970)","subtitle":"Notes on Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryū Suzuki","date":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","lectures","zen","buddhism","mindfulness"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1900-1949/kafka-franz-investigations-of-a-dog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kafka, Franz; Investigations of a Dog (1922)","subtitle":"Notes on Investigations of a Dog by Franz Kafka","date":"2022-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","investigations of a dog","kafka, franz","philosophy","absurdism"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1950-1999/vonnegut-kurt-slaughterhouse-five/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vonnegut Jr., Kurt; Slaughterhouse-Five (1969)","subtitle":"Notes on Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.","date":"2022-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","kurt vonnegut","slaughterhouse-five","war","world war ii","time","science fiction","irony"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/misc/bathroom-epigraphs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A collection of bathroom epigraphs","subtitle":"The words of prophets are written on bathroom walls","date":"2022-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1800s/carroll-lewis-alice-in-wonderland/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Carroll, Lewis; Alice in Wonderland (1865)","subtitle":"Notes on Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll","date":"2022-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","lewis carroll","alice in wonderland","fantasy"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Buffalo in the Enclosure Kōan Goso said: “When a buffalo goes out of his enclosure to the edge of the abyss, his horns and his head and his hoofs all pass through, but why can’t the tail also pass?

People tend to overestimate the difference between two things with a boundary between them (we call one color “red” and another “violet,” when in reality they are closer in color than two shades of “red”). When people focus on categorical thinking, they lose out on the bigger picture. No single bucket provides the Ultimate Explanation: they are all necessary for a complete understanding of any system (in this case, biology and behavior).

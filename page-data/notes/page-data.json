T.) Suzuki (1870-1966) brought Zen to the West (with a focus on satori, or enlightenment), and fifty years later, Shunryū Suzuki (1904-1971) did similarly, but with less focus on satori. On preparing his students for his death, he said: If when I die, the moment I’m dying, if I suffer that is all\nright, you know; that is suffering Buddha. No confusion\nin it. Maybe everyone will struggle because of the physical\nagony or spiritual agony, too. But that is all right, that is\nnot a problem. We should be very grateful to have a\nlimited body…like mine, or like yours. If you had a\nlimitless life it would be a real problem for you. Introduction Zen mind is a phrase used by teachers to invoke the purpose of Zen in their students: “to make you wonder and to answer that wondering with the deepest expression of your own nature.”\nTo practice Zen mind is beginner’s mind (shoshin), or the “innocence of the first inquiry—what am I”?\nThe beginner’s mind is…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/essays/spirituality/suzuki-shunryu-zen-mind-beginners-mind/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Suzuki, Shunryū; Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind (1970)","subtitle":"Notes on Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryū Suzuki","date":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","lectures","zen","buddhism","mindfulness"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Prerequisite Knowledge  0.

The chi-squared test can only be used on categorical (i.e., nominal, discrete) data — so yes to the number of people in a certain gender, race/ethnicity, or political category, but no to heights, weights, lengths (unless you discretize your data first).\nUnlike other common hypothesis tests like the t-test, the chi-squared test is non-parametric, meaning that it does not rely on assumptions about the distribution of the data.\nInstead, it measures whether the data is likely to be drawn from a given distribution.

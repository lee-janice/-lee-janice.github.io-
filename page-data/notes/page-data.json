Mumon’s Commentary If anyone can open one eye at this point and say a word of Zen, he is qualified to repay the four gratifications, and, not only that, he can save all sentient beings under him.\nBut if he cannot say such a word of Zen, he should turn back to his tail. Mumon’s Poem  The Short Staff Kōan Shuzan held out his short staff and said: “If you call this a short staff, you oppose its reality.\nIf you do not call it a short staff, you ignore the fact.\nNow what do you wish to call this?” Mumon’s Commentary If you call this a short staff, you oppose its reality.\nIf you do not call it a short staff, you ignore the fact.\nIt cannot be expressed with words and it cannot be expressed without words.\nNow say quickly what it is.

People tend to overestimate the difference between two things with a boundary between them (we call one color “red” and another “violet,” when in reality they are closer in color than two shades of “red”). When people focus on categorical thinking, they lose out on the bigger picture. No single bucket provides the Ultimate Explanation: they are all necessary for a complete understanding of any system (in this case, biology and behavior). So, we should not fall for thinking that one bucket is the key to the answer.

We are precious in the cosmic perspective. The question then becomes: can this be realized in a system of education? Can we actualize ourselves and each other through our pedagogies?</p>\n<p>To investigate these questions, I propose the following concentration: <em>Pedagogical Praxis: Theory, Process, and Practice</em>. This concentration is rooted in the Freirean conception of praxis, which he defines in <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em> as “reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.” This definition is paramount. Reflection sans action would be mere speculation, and action sans reflection would be mere folly. I believe that it is the dialectic between the two that can give rise to true radical change.</p>\n<p>A central question to consider, then, is <em>how can—and how should—we change</em>? In order to propose an answer, we should recall an idea as old as time itself: to know where to go from here, we must invariably look to where we have been. This is the forte of the fields of history and philosophy. I suggest that any inquiry would be incomplete without a voyage into either.</p>\n<p>I thus offer Theory as the contemplation of the philosophical, cultural, and societal underpinnings of the current educational practice. Through the disciplines of philosophy, history, and the social sciences, I hope to trace the development of theories of education and mind throughout histories and engage in their comparative analysis; to practice reflective reading, writing, and dialogue with peers and mentors; and to synthesize this knowledge into a richer understanding of contemporary issues in education.</p>\n<p>Just as our current pedagogies are founded upon the millennia upon millennia of development that came before us, so too are they influenced by the immediate moment. In the immediate moment, we find Process, or the mechanisms by which pedagogy is enacted—both the cognitive correlates of learning as well as the design that facilitates it. I believe that any educational practice should be, in a sense, <em>cognitively ergonomic</em>. There is that which can extinguish curiosity and wonder, and there is that which can make the heart and mind sing. My hope is for more of the latter.</p>\n<p>To investigate what practices can evoke the melodies of the mind, I will draw upon the relatively nascent fields of cognitive science and the learning sciences, with a vested interest in theories of consciousness, awareness, and metacognition. At the end of this journey, I hope to become fluent in the “grammar” of cognition and the neurological processes behind learning; to explore the role that awareness and metacognition can play in pedagogy; and to develop hypotheses as to what practices are conducive to an abundant education of mind, body, and soul.</p>\n<p>Theory and Process belong to the realm of reflection. What, then, of action?</p>\n<p>I propose Practice as the means of transforming the potency of reflection into the reality of act. Through Practice, I hope to both learn and apply research methods to pedagogical development; to connect to people and communities for change; and to ultimately cumulate my understanding and experience into a Master’s thesis that will extend beyond my time at Gallatin.</p>\n<p>The Gallatin school is the only place where I can realize this vision. I have considered other programs—especially those at Steinhardt—but they seem to me to be either too periscopic or too myopic. Only at Gallatin can I establish a balance between theory and application that fully resonates with me.</p>\n<p>Finally, I feel that the Gallatin approach is one that strikes closer to the heart of education, although it is currently unclear to me what exactly that may be. I do strongly believe, however, that in an actualizing education, one must grant the learner the agency to shape their intellectual path—and Gallatin is the only institution that offers me the tool to forge my own.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Education as reflection and action","subtitle":"My (rejected) statement of purpose for the Master's program at NYU Gallatin","date":"2023-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["essays","education","praxis"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/notes/personal/nyu-gallatin-personal-statement/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1950-1999/vonnegut-kurt-the-sirens-of-titan/"},"frontmatter":{"topics":["notes","kurt vonnegut","science fiction","purpose"],"title":"Vonnegut Jr., Kurt; The Sirens of Titan (1959)","layout":"booknote","published":true,"booknote":[{"author":"Kurt Vonnegut Jr.","title":"The Sirens of Titan"}]}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

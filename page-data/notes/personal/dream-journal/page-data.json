no\ncontinuation of dream, driving in the mountains and it was nighttime and saw this guy w dog attached to his chest w a leash, and something about mapping some human emotions to a topology and the results corresponding w some skeleton (hip bone) of ancient ppl I had in the backseat of my car, and someone else was in my car, and he said good job look what you've done w ur potential, and I said

coldstone</p>\n<h2>2021-07-24</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>dream about vacation on a place along the coast and there was a temple slash house thing with lots of pictures on the wall and the first floor was like a dojo or something and A met me there but then my mom and sister came and then he disappeared and then switched to this other place with a house and mom said she wasnt going to support me anymore and

this asian guy trying to make me like him and then being in this class where the guy is a killer and is slowly killing each of the classmates and we have to figure out who is the real killer but all I

Derry and Claire generous and other people and Kukie was there and they were going to go to a mountain and I needed to look after Kukie and i was scratching her face and she smiled at me\nsomething about a timed test in red ink and a lot of fruit from the harvest and minji was there\nand I had a flight but everyone left without me and I talked to Brandon on the phone and I rode this taxi to the airport and something about McDonald's\nthen somehow I ended up at doordash and two people played this game with a ball like kick ball and there was a whiteboard named Doug and li asked me about my

said no, look at all the evidence (police always around him, other stuff i forgot) like does he do this? does this happen around him? and i was screaming and crying saying that i didnt care, he's my dad, i want to see him, and then i woke up</p>\n<h2>2020-11-01</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>dream about getting into a spaceship and going inside an atom and inside the atom was another universe\nIn the beginning, I was at what appeared to be a space station of sorts. Shuttles ebbed and flowed from the terminal, but I didn't know where they were coming from, or where they were heading. A shuttle stopped in front of me, and I had the inexplicable urge to board it. The shuttle's interior looked like an airplane's, and I took a window seat. As soon as I sat down, the shuttle took off. It shrunk down to less than the size of an atom. The next thing I knew, it entered one of my own cells. I looked outside, and I saw that there was a whole universe inside of this cell. Tiny planets and stars littered the vast emptiness, and a double helix threaded the dark space together.</p>\n<h2>2020-05-25</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>dream about death game with cards</p>\n<h2>2020-06-24</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>in my dream we were moving back to school but like the dorms were in tents outside like sorta like the farmers markets tents but there were beds where the

tunnels and someone in front of me was carrying yamashita who was about to die\nit was rly high pressure but it ended right after i got in the kayak\n3 We were at college and in a room for some reason

guarded by 2 girls with pink hair but we got past them by holding the hands of 2 purple haired mannequins which put them in a trance\nThen he was laying in a bed with a weird creepy mask over his face

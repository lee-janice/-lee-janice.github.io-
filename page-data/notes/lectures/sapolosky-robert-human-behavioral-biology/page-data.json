Synaptic adjustments will then modify the corresponding ideas and force them into different channels. Using this approach we obtain cures and improvements but no failures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div> \n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Konrad Lorenz, a founding father of ethology and a Nazi propagandist</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='epigraph'>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The selection for toughness, heroism, social utility...must be accomplished by some human institution if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div> \n<p>In the remainder of the course, the intellectual challenge will be to not fall into categorical thinking, to continually assume and then abandon each conceptual bucket. We have to realize the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There are circumstances in which we are like every other animal. One example is the McClintock effect, which is the synchronization of female menstrual cycles when in close proximity.<sup id=\"fnref-mcclintock\"><a href=\"#fn-mcclintock\" class=\"footnote-ref\">mcclintock</a></sup></li>\n<li>There are other circumstances in which we appear to be similar, but are in fact doing something very different. For instance, chess grandmasters display metabolic activity on par with that of a marathon runner. The same physiological pathways are being used in both cases, but in a completely alternate way.</li>\n<li>There are still other circumstances in which we are truly unique, such as our use of language.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Lecture 2: Behavioral Evolution I</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 3: Behavioral Evolution II</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 4: Molecular Genetics I</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 5: Molecular Genetics II</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 6: Behavioral Genetics I</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 7: Behavioral Genetics II</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 8: Recognizing Relatives</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 9: Ethology</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 10: Introduction to Neuroscience I</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 11: Introduction to Neuroscience II</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 12: Endocrinology</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 13: Advanced Neurology and Endocrinology</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 14: Limbic System</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 15: Human Sexual Behavior I</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 16: Human Sexual Behavior II</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 17: Human Sexual Behavior II</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 18: Human Sexual Behavior III and Aggression I</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 19: Aggression II</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 20: Aggression III</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 21: Aggression IV</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 22: Chaos and Reductionism</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 23: Emergence and Complexity</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 24: Language</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 25: Schizophrenia</h2>\n<h2>Lecture 26: Individual Differences</h2>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-mcclintock\">According to Wikipedia, a 2013 review found that this effect likely does not exist.

You may object that these aren’t proceedings at all, and you’re certainly right there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such… what has happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I don’t take it very seriously, but it is typical of the proceedings being brought against many people. I speak for them, not myself… The examining magistrate here beside me has just given one of you a secret signal. So there are those among you who are being directed from up here… there can be no doubt that behind all the pronouncements of this court, and in my case, behind the arrest and today’s inquiry, there exists an extensive organization. An organization that not only engages corrupt guards, inane inspectors, and examining magistrates who are at best mediocre, but that supports as well a system of judges of all ranks, including the highest, with their inevitable innumerable entourage of assistants, scribes, gendarmes, and other aides, perhaps even hangmen, I won’t shy away from the word… So!… I see you’re all officials, you’re the corrupt band I was speaking about; you’ve crowded in here to listen and snoop, you’ve formed apparent parties and had one side applaud to test me, you wanted to learn how to lead innocent men astray.” <footer> K. addressing the assembly; <em>chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), pages 45-52</em>; importance: 1 </footer></p>\n</blockquote><blockquote>\n<p>The two parties, which had appeared to hold such contrasting opinions before, mingled with one another, some people pointing their fingers at K., others at the examining magistrate. The foglike haze in the room was extremely annoying, even preventing any closer observation of those standing further away… K. was interrupted by a shriek from the other end of the hall; he shaded his eyes so that he could see, for the dull daylight had turned the haze into a blinding white glare. <footer> <em>chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), pages 49 and 51</em>; importance: 2 </footer></p>\n</blockquote><blockquote>\n<p>“I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact,” said the examining magistrate, “that you have today deprived yourself — although you can’t yet have realized it — the advantage that an interrogation offers to the arrested man in each case.” <footer> Dialogue from examining magistrate to K.; <em>chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), page 52</em>; importance: 1 </footer></p>\n</blockquote></section>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kafka, Franz; The Trial","subtitle":"Notes on The Trial by Franz Kafka, translated by Breon Mitchell","date":"2021-10-01","lastupdated":"2021-10-01","topics":["notes","the trial","kafka, franz","philosophy","absurdism"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/notes/books/fiction/absurdism/kafka-franz-the-trial/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/01/"},"frontmatter":{"topics":["journal","the trial","kafka, franz","ms. lauryn hill"],"title":"October 1st 2021"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/notes/personal/dream-journal/"},"frontmatter":{"topics":["notes","dreams","personal","liminality","subconscious"],"title":"Dream journal"}}}},

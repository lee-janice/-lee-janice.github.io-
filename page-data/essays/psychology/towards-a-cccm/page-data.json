This process is three-fold: (1) new material is <em>anchored</em> to\nrelevant preexisting concepts, (2) the two <em>interact</em> to produce new meanings, and (3) the new meanings are <em>connected</em>\nto their anchoring concepts. Central to his theory is this notion of cognitive structure, or the hierarchically-organized\nframework of knowledge that serves as an anchoring site for new ideas. To Ausubel, the availability, stability, clarity,\nand discriminability of concepts in cognitive structure are the principal factors influencing meaningful learning.</p><p>One hypothesis resulting from this claim predicts that meaningful learning more readily occurs if one’s cognitive\nstructure is clear, stable, and well-organized than if it is vague, unreliable, or disordered (Ausubel, 1968, 2000). This\nhypothesis has been put to the test through studies of Ausubel’s (1960) advance organizers (AOs), with the\nfundamental conjecture being that the organizer provides an anchoring structure for the incorporation of new ideas and\nthus facilitates meaningful learning. The initial outlook for this hypothesis was favorable: in his inaugural paper on\nAOs, Ausubel (1960) reported that undergraduate students who received an expository AO on metallurgy\noutperformed those who were administered a historical passage on the same topic. Four subsequent studies demonstrated\nsimilar results in favor of AOs (Ausubel &#x26; Fitzgerald, 1961, 1962; Fitzgerald &#x26; Ausbel, 1963; Ausubel &#x26; Youssef, 1965).</p><p>However, as the body of research on the subject expanded, an increasing number of studies failed to replicate\nthese outcomes. In a notable meta-analysis of the research, Barnes &#x26; Clawson (1975) found that in 20 of the 32 studies\nunder their review, AOs did not produce significant results. They ultimately concluded that “advance organizers, as\npresently constructed, generally do not facilitate learning” (p. 651). These remarks provoked a lively meta-analytic\ndefense of AOs in which numerous other authors not only noted that in the studies under <em>their</em> review, significant\nresults outnumbered non-significant ones, but also suggested that Barnes &#x26; Clawson had failed to adequately judge\nthe implications of Ausubel’s theory for learning outcomes and that their methodology of meta-analysis was\nsuspect (Mayer, 1979a, 1979b; Lawton &#x26; Wanska, 1977; Stone, 1983; Luiten et al., 1980). Even Ausubel (1978) himself\npublished a strongly-worded response to his critics, retorting that had his accusers read his previous publications\nin sufficient detail, they would not have dared to make such claims. Since this flurry of activity in the 70s and 80s,\nthere does not appear to have been another comprehensive meta-analysis of AOs’ effect on learning. It suffices to say\nthat the evidence as to whether or not AOs facilitate meaningful learning remains inconclusive.</p><p>Regardless of the controversy of Ausubel’s advance organizers, his assimilation theory continued to find\napplications in research and practice, with the most notable example being Novak’s concept mapping tool. Novak and\nhis team were compelled by three central aspects of Ausubel’s theory: first, that new meanings are built upon prior\nconcepts; second, that cognitive structure is hierarchically-organized; and third, that meaningful learning improves\nthe precision and clarity of relationships between concepts (Novak &#x26; Cañas, 2006). Their resulting tool represents\n<em>concepts</em> as labeled nodes, and their <em>relationships</em> as labeled edges. Two concepts and their relation to each other\nform a meaningful <em>proposition.</em> Several meta-analyses regarding the efficacy of concept maps demonstrate positive\neffects on learning (Horton et al., 1993; Nesbit &#x26; Adesope, 2006; Schroeder et al., 2018).</p><p>The notion of representing knowledge as a network of concepts and propositions bears strong similarities to\nmethods of representing data in an information ontology (Vickery, 1997), or a formal organization of information in\na knowledge base. Information ontologies are widely utilized to represent web-based collections of data, such as the\nWikidata database, off of which Wikipedia is partially based. Wikidata’s ontology represents a unit of knowledge as\nan <em>item</em> and relates two items via <em>properties</em>. A meaningful statement can be retrieved from the database through a\n<code class=\"language-text\">Subject-Predicate-Object</code> query (Erxleben et al., 2014). The bijection with Novak’s set of <em>concepts</em>, <em>relationships</em>,\nand <em>propositions</em> is clear. This design choice affords a potential extension of Novak’s concept mapping tool from an\n<em>individual</em> learner’s—or even individual <em>expert’s</em>—representation of a <em>singular</em> domain, to a <em>collaboratively-constructed</em>\nmapping of <em>all</em> concepts described by what is arguably the largest existing repository of human knowledge.</p><p>Two important considerations come to mind. First, Ausubel’s assimilation theory is quite imbued within the\ncognitivist tradition—that is, it deals primarily with the <em>symbolic</em> representation and manipulation of concepts in\ncognitive structure. It says little of learning beyond the individual mind. As it is now commonly understood that\nlearning is not only cognitive, but also material, social, and cultural in nature (Brown et al., 1989), the limitations of\nAusubel’s theory must be addressed. Second, as the controversy surrounding Ausubel’s AOs demonstrates, isolating\nand measuring the utility of such tools for facilitating meaningful learning can be an arduous endeavor. An open\ntask is to develop adequate methodologies for determining whether or not such a positive effect exists.</p></section>\n<section><h2 id=\"references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"no-tufte-underline before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h2><p>Ausubel, D.

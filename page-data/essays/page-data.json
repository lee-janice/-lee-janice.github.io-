This process is three-fold: (1) new material is anchored to\nrelevant preexisting concepts, (2) the two interact to produce new meanings, and (3) the new meanings are connected\nto their anchoring concepts. Central to his theory is this notion of cognitive structure, or the hierarchically-organized\nframework of knowledge that serves as an anchoring site for new ideas. To Ausubel, the availability, stability, clarity,\nand discriminability of concepts in cognitive structure are the principal factors influencing meaningful learning. One hypothesis resulting from this claim predicts that meaningful learning more readily occurs if one’s cognitive\nstructure is clear, stable, and well-organized than if it is vague, unreliable, or disordered (Ausubel, 1968, 2000).

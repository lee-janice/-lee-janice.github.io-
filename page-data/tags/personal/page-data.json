After a long bout of mental anguish and intense contemplation regarding myself, my memories, my relationships, and my place in the grand scheme of the universe, I’ve come to the conclusion that the concept of a unified, cohesive self may very well be illusory, and that accepting myself as everchanging and interconnected potential rather than trying to cram the totality of who I am into a concrete, fixed reality does wonders for my wellbeing. That being said, the concept of myself still exists, floating around in the ambient space of consciousness.\nI created this document to capture some of those concepts.\nI hope that it will lend itself to a picture in your mind of who I am or who I was at some point in time.\nHowever, I do have trouble describing myself (see above), so if you really want to get to know me, contact me! ☺ “Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.”  — Aristotle  “Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle.”  — Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland   Where have I been and what have I done?  Where am I and what am I doing? This is a good question, and a hard one to respond to.\nI have no idea what I’m doing most of the time.\nIn terms of major life events, I’m currently residing in Los Angeles, recovering from a major existential crisis that occurred shortly after my undergraduate graduation, and am now applying to jobs!\nI’m interviewing for a technical research analyst position at the NYU-hosted Research Alliance for NYC Schools.\nFingers crossed!

But that we are attached  to  some beauty is itself Buddha’s  activity.  That we do not care for weeds is also Buddha’s activity. We should know that.  If you know that, it is all right to attach to something.  If it is Buddha’s attachment, that is non-attachment.  So in love  there should be hate, or non-attachment.  And in hate there should be love, or acceptance.  Love and hate are one thing.  - Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind  In short, I like everything.\nWhat’s not to like about the miracles of the universe, whether conventionally good or bad?\nBut while I do like everything, I get attached to particular things.\nHere are some of those things.

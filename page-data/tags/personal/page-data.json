After a long bout of mental anguish and intense contemplation regarding myself, my memories, my relationships, and my place in the grand scheme of the universe, I’ve come to the conclusion that the concept of a unified, cohesive self may very well be illusory, and that accepting myself as everchanging and interconnected potential rather than trying to cram the totality of who I am into a concrete, fixed reality does wonders for my wellbeing. That being said, the concept of myself still exists, floating around in the ambient space of consciousness.\nI created this document to capture some of those concepts.\nI hope that it will lend itself to a picture in your mind of who I am or who I was at some point in time.\nHowever, I do have trouble describing myself (see above), so if you really want to get to know me, contact me! ☺ “Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.”  — Aristotle  “Who in the world am I?

Current interests In light of my aforementioned existential crisis, I’ve awakened a huge appetite for gathering information about the nature of us, consciousness, reality, love, the universe, and other abstract and intangible concepts.\nOne of the realizations to come out of this crisis is the incredible interconnectedness of all things - everything is everything else - and as such I’d like to get exposure to all sorts of people, experiences, and ideas.

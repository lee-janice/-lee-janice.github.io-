is the hope that it will be an extension of my limited self.\nFor most of my life, I’ve suffered from a slight feeling of lack — the universe is brimming with information and the computational power of my pea-sized brain is no match for the immensity of it all.\nI’ve even forgotten much of what it was like to be myself at any moment in time besides the current one!\nAlthough I’ve mostly come to terms with this fact, I realized that there are a plethora of tools at my disposal that I can use to enrich my views of the world and of myself.\nWith that in mind, I identified a few ways in which I hope this website will extend my concept of my self and my understanding.</p><h3 id=\"deeper-understanding-and-reflection\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

everything. <footer> - Thich Nhat Hanh; <em>The Sun, My Heart</em> </footer></p>\n</blockquote></div><p>I’ve realized how much of my information consumption has been subsisting off of “fast food for the mind.”\nWhenever I had a question or thought about a random topic, the near-instantaneous nature of a Google search and the convenience of a few Reddit threads satisfed my truth-seeking itch, but did little to offer information of substance.\nI found myself skimming over articles, seeking shorter-form content, and relegating my information-seeking process to the inner workings of algorithms and infinite-scroll platforms.\nEven during my undergraduate education, the pressure and time constraints of classes led me to rely on cognitive tricks and shortcuts, rather than a more comprehensive grasp of the subject matter and its various contexts.\nEssentially, convenience and efficiency had supplanted my desire for deep understanding.</p><p>And like a diet consisting of Big Macs, 20-piece chicken nuggets, and super-sized Cokes, this left my mind slightly nutritionally deficient and unable to process richer, more substantive content.\nIt was difficult for me to focus on and digest novels, and even a few days after finishing a book, I would struggle to recall small details and even overarching themes or symbolism.\nThis struggle extended to all forms of media and data.\nIt was a signal of my deteriorating information-processing abilities — a deterioration that pervaded all minutae of my life.\nI felt dumb as bricks.</p><p>I eventually grasped that what I lacked was not cognitive capabilities, but rather time and awareness.\nI forgot what I read not because I was stupid or my memory was failing me, but because I wasn’t dedicating time to flush the concepts out, add them to a network of connections to other ideas, and analyse how I changed as a result of this process.\nI was mindlessly macking down fistfuls of information and only paying attention to the stink of the shit that came out the other end, not the ways in which the information was subliminally enriching my life or challenging my normative thought patterns or opening doors for further exploration.\nIn light of this, I awakened an internal desire to slow down and become truly aware of what I was consuming.</p><p>Thus, I hope that writing and posting to this website will encourage me to engage in slower, deeper reflection and contemplation.\nI don’t want a Number-2-protein-style-with-onions-and-7-Up<label for=\"sd-although-this-is-a\" class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\"></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"sd-although-this-is-a\" class=\"margin-toggle\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Although, this is a top tier, elite In-N-Out order.</span>.\nI want to make that burger from scratch, damn it!\nI want to savor every moment of the process, from the conception to realization.\nI want a time and space to build a robust network of thoughts and ideas that weave themselves together into a personal philosophy, and this website is the manifestation of these desires.</p><h3 id=\"cultivation-of-personal-understanding\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

Aristotle </footer></p>\n</blockquote></div><p>I mentioned earlier that I’ve forgotten much of what it was like to be myself.\nFor various reasons, my sense of time and autobiographical memory is a tangled mess.\nSometimes I think about my past and it feels dizzyingly foreign, like I’ve dissociated and am observing someone else’s life.\nOr a recurring thought or feeling is on the tip of my tongue, but it’s incredibly fuzzy and dream-like and I can’t give it a form.\nOr I try and fail to remember what my cognitive processes were like before a certain event.\nThis is a phenomenon that truly bothers me.\nIt bothers me because in the forgetting, it feels as though I’ve lost some dimension of the richness of my life.\nIt also makes it harder to empathize with my past self, since I’ve forgotten the reasons why I acted a certain way.\nAnd although these concepts and events are outside of the realm of my explicit awareness, they are embedded in my thoughts and actions, like spectres of the past.\nAnd not being aware of these subliminal perspectives and habits makes it incredibly easy to fall victim to a perpetual cycle of thoughtless doing and makes it incredibly hard to do otherwise.</p><p>So, I want to create a memory breadcrumb trail so that I can revisit the states of mind that I held at various points in time — one that can’t be eaten by birds — and I want this website to be a personal Wikipedia of my thoughts that grows naturally over time.\nI hope that it will be a resource that helps me come to a better understanding of who I am.</p><h3

of burdens crushes us, we sink beneath it, it pins us to the ground.

The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become. Conversely, the absolute absence of burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant.

You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow.

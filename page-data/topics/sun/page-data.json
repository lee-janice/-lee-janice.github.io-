A golden beam seeks, and as it finds, transforms— \nat tender glance, multiplicities adorn— \nteeming and glimmering, creation adores \n                   \n                   \n  \nall to be reborn. But into high noon does a lover dare gaze— \ncraving a story, blinding splendor and blaze— \ndid Apollo weep sage as Icarus razed \n                   \n                   \n  \nthrough the barren haze? Yet a creature still longs to see and be seen— \na yearning to bask in evening amber gleam— \na gentle coaxing beckons all to heed, what \n                   \n                   \n  \nstrange attraction deems. And even the Sun, in an amethyst light— \ngrape seed, half twist against eternity’s might— \nwith no triumphs over this life—goes gentle\n                   \n                   \n  \ninto that good night.","fields":{"slug":"/notes/writing/ave-solis/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ave Solis","subtitle":"A Sapphic ode to the glory of a Sun","date":"2024-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2024-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["writing","poetry","sun"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"sun"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

I was looking at my eyes in the bathroom of Coffee Connection, and I realized that they have the same shape as the eyes on the cover of my edition of The Trial… ☹ reminds me of A telling me that I have “crazy eyes”… ☹  Saw something very dystopian-reminiscent today:  What the f? This billboard FORCES you to look at it, since it extends halfway across the freakin’ street.\nHow is this legal? This is one of those LED/digital billboards that have been popping up everywhere as of late. The ad before this one was BRIGHT blue and yellow and was extremely distracting on the road — could you imagine what this would look like at night?\nHow terrifying is it that advertising agencies and urban planners or whoever is responsible for this atrocity would perpetuate consumerism a manner that jeopardizes the safety of drivers?\nThis is horrifying to me. Other random thoughts: saw a black butterfly with white winged tips today while playing ball with Darla, reminds me of catching butterflies in childhood and how the bushes seemed so tall then","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/01/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"October 1st 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-10-01; more thoughts on The Trial; connections to Mystery of Iniquity by Ms. Lauryn Hill","date":"2021-10-01","lastupdated":"2021-10-01","topics":["journal","the trial","kafka, franz","ms. lauryn hill"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Found out from the director of the Research Alliance that I got the position!!! NYC bound, baby!\nI’m extremely excited, but also a little nervous — NYC seems like a huge city (LA is no doubt much larger, but it’s shrunk by my access to a car) and I’m not quite sure how to get my stuff across the country. But I’m certain I’ll figure things out! Finished reading The Trial by Franz Kafka today. A plot recap for myself: Arrest in K.’s room → talk with Frau Grubach → talk with Fräulein Bürstner → appearance in court → encounter with washlady → visit to law offices → two guards and the flogger in the maintenance room → visit from K.’s uncle and visit to the lawyer → conversation with the painter → visit to lawyer for his dismissal, Block the merchant → cathederal → the ending Some initial notes and questions before I go back to revisit the quotes I marked: themes of pride, ego, shame, doubt, guilt, anxiety, paranoia, and transaction in opposition to love, faith, and unconditional acceptance can be read multiple ways, but I think it is more complex, existential, and metaphysical than a condemnation of bureaucracy resonates with my Crisis and in general, the torment of the human psyche paranoia throughout the novel reminds me of the day following the peak of the Crisis and how my own mother was scaring me, how I was analyzing/reading so far into her actions and words to the point that everything she did seemed so foreign and cold and calculating and transactional, when I just desperately wanted/needed comfort and assurance that things would be okay the two guards at the end are like manifestations of cognitive dissonance and indecision the ending also reminds me of “For the Good Times” by Al Green: when presented with the whirling chaos of life and the nonsensicality of it all, what can one do but resign one’s head and hope for a tender embrace? I’m currently listening to “Louange à l’Éternité de Jésus” from Quartet for the End of Time (performed by Yo-Yo Ma on his album Songs from the Arc of Life), and I’m thinking of how this would be a perfect song to accompany the ending of the novel from when I listened to it: slowing down, inevitability, ominous, like the ticking of a clock from wikipedia: Jesus is considered here as the Word. A broad phrase, “infinitely slow”, on the cello, magnifies with love and reverence the eternity of the Word, powerful and gentle, “whose time never runs out”. The melody stretches majestically into a kind of gentle, regal distance. “In…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/09/30/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"September 30th 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-09-30; life update; finished The Trial; other random thoughts","date":"2021-09-30","lastupdated":"2021-10-01","topics":["journal","life update","the trial","kafka, franz","the Crisis","mother","father","songs from the arc of life","capgras"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"the trial"}},

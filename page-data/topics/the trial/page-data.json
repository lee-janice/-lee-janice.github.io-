That’s all we are, but we’re smart enough to realize that before ordering such an arrest the higher authorities who employ us inform themselves in great detail about the person they’re arresting and the grounds for the arrest. There’s been no mistake.   Dialogue from guard to K.; chapter 1 (Arrest), page 8; importance: 4  The inspector cries out as if he has to wake me up, practically shouting; unfortunately I’ll have to shout too, to show you how it was; all he shouts is his name, by the way.   Dialogue from K. to Fräulein Bürstner; chapter 2 (Conversation with Frau Grubach, then Fräulein Bürstner), page 31 importance: 3  … before falling asleep he reflected briefly on his conduct: he was pleased with it, but was surprised that he didn’t feel even more pleased; he was seriously concerned on Fräulein Bürstner’s behalf because of the captain.  chapter 2 (Conversation with Frau Grubach, then Fräulein Bürstner), page 33; importance: 3  He regretted his plan, which had at first seemed so practical. As he was approaching the fifth floor he decided to give up the search, took his leave from a friendly young worker who wanted to lead him further upward, and started back down. But then, annoyed once more by the futility of the whole enterprise, he returned and knocked at the first door on the fifth floor.  chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), page 41; importance: 4  K. let him lead the way; it turned out that there was indeed a narrow path free through the swirling crowd, one that possibly divided two parties; this possibility was further supported by the fact that K. saw scarcely a face turned toward him in the closest rows on his left and right, but merely the backs of people addressing their words and gestures solely to those in their own party.  chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), page 42; importance: 4  “Your question, Your Honor, about my being a house painter — and you weren’t really asking at all, you were telling me outright — is characteristic of the way these entire proceedings against me are being conducted. You may object that these aren’t proceedings at all, and you’re certainly right there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such… what has happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I don’t take it very seriously, but it is typical…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/fiction/absurdism/kafka-franz-the-trial/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-10-01","title":"Kafka, Franz; The Trial","subtitle":"Notes on The Trial by Franz Kafka, translated by Breon Mitchell","topics":["notes","the trial","kafka, franz","philosophy","absurdism"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Found out from the director of the Research Alliance that I got the position!!! NYC bound, baby!\nI’m extremely excited, but also a little nervous — NYC seems like a huge city (LA is no doubt much larger, but it’s shrunk by my access to a car) and I’m not quite sure how to get my stuff across the country. But I’m certain I’ll figure things out! Finished reading The Trial by Franz Kafka today. A plot recap for myself: Arrest in K.’s room → talk with Frau Grubach → talk with Fräulein Bürstner → appearance in court → encounter with washlady → visit to law offices → two guards and the flogger in the maintenance room → visit from K.’s uncle and visit to the lawyer → conversation with the painter → visit to lawyer for his dismissal, Block the merchant → cathederal → the ending Some initial notes and questions before I go back to revisit the quotes I marked: themes of pride, ego, shame, doubt, guilt, anxiety, paranoia, and transaction in opposition to love, faith, and unconditional acceptance can be read multiple ways, but I think it is more complex, existential, and metaphysical than a condemnation of bureaucracy resonates with my Crisis and in general, the torment of the human psyche paranoia throughout the novel reminds me of the day following the peak of the Crisis and how my own mother was scaring me, how I was analyzing/reading so far into her actions and words to the point that everything she did seemed so foreign and cold and calculating and transactional, when I just desperately wanted/needed comfort and assurance that things would be okay the two guards at the end are like manifestations of cognitive dissonance and indecision the ending also reminds me of “For the Good Times” by Al Green: when presented with the whirling chaos of life and the nonsensicality of it all, what can one do but resign one’s head and hope for a tender embrace? I’m currently listening to “Louange à l’Éternité de Jésus” from Quartet for the End of Time (performed by Yo-Yo Ma on his album Songs from the Arc of Life), and I’m thinking of how this would be a perfect song to accompany the ending of the novel from when I listened to it: slowing down, inevitability, ominous, like the ticking of a clock from wikipedia: Jesus is considered here as the Word. A broad phrase, “infinitely slow”, on the cello, magnifies with love and reverence the eternity of the Word, powerful and gentle, “whose time never runs out”. The melody stretches majestically into a kind of gentle, regal distance. “In…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/09/30/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-09-30","title":"September 30th 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-09-30; life update; finished The Trial; other random thoughts","topics":["journal","life update","the trial","kafka, franz","the Crisis","mother","father","songs from the arc of life","capgras"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Thinking more about The Trial today.\nI was listening to “Mystery of Iniquity (Unplugged)” by Ms. Lauryn Hill while on a drive, and it reminded me very strongly of the institution of the court in K.’s trial.\nHere are some of the lyrics: Jesus, if this is not masterful lyricism, then I don’t know what is.\nSome versus that strike me as particularly relevant to The Trial: The more money you pay.. the further away solution And the defense isn’t making any sense // Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence Expert witness (the paid authority) // Made a priority to deceive the majority // Of disinterested peers // Dodging duty for years //Hating the process // waiting to be returning to their careers The truth is obsolete // Only two positions: // Victimizer or Victim // Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system The Revolving Door // Insanity every floor // Skyscraping, paper chasing // What are we working for? I was looking at my eyes in the bathroom of Coffee Connection, and I realized that they have the same shape as the eyes on the cover of my edition of The Trial… ☹ reminds me of A telling me that I have “crazy eyes”… ☹  Saw something very dystopian-reminiscent today:  What the f? This billboard FORCES you to look at it, since it extends halfway across the freakin’ street.\nHow is this legal? This is one of those LED/digital billboards that have been popping up everywhere as of late. The ad before this one was BRIGHT blue and yellow and was extremely distracting on the road — could you imagine what this would look like at night?\nHow terrifying is it that advertising agencies and urban planners or whoever is responsible for this atrocity would perpetuate consumerism a manner that jeopardizes the safety of drivers?\nThis is horrifying to me. Other random thoughts: saw a black butterfly with white winged tips today while playing ball with Darla, reminds me of catching butterflies in childhood and how the bushes seemed so tall then","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/01/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-10-01","title":"October 1st 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-10-01; more thoughts on The Trial; connections to Mystery of Iniquity by Ms. Lauryn Hill","topics":["journal","the trial","kafka, franz","ms. lauryn hill"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"the trial"}},

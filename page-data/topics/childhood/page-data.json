Finished reading A Wind in the Door recently.\nI’m trying to revisit books that meant a lot to me as a kid. “No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally - and often far more - worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.”  — C.S. Lewis  And in revisiting this book, I’ve realized how much it probably influenced me and my general worldview.\nFor example, a recurring concept in the book is the relativity of size: the protagonists visit organelles smaller than mitochondria and observe phenomena on the scale of galaxies.\nBut in each of these experiences, there are the same principles and patterns that repeat themselves across time and space.\nThe hierarchy in A Wind in the Door goes: farandolae → mitochondria → human → planet → galaxy → universe.\nIt reminds me of my Crisis revelation of how things are nested into each other like matryoshka (Russian nesting) dolls.\nAlso, I’m sure that this book influenced this dream that I had that can be found in my dream journal: In the beginning, I was at what appeared to be a space station of sorts. Shuttles ebbed and flowed from the terminal, but I didn’t know where they were coming from, or where they were heading. A shuttle stopped in front of me, and I had the inexplicable urge to board it. The shuttle’s interior looked like an airplane’s, and I took a window seat. As soon as I sat down, the shuttle took off. It shrunk down to less than the size of an atom. The next thing I knew, it entered one of my own cells. I looked outside, and I saw that there was a whole universe inside of this cell. Tiny planets and stars littered the vast emptiness, and a double helix threaded the dark space together. … and this reminds me of The Universe in a Single Atom by the Dalai Lama. A Wind in the Door also contains messages about the interconnected nature of things.\nOne of the characters references this proverb: For want of a nail a shoe was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; for want of a horse the rider was lost; for want of a rider the message was lost; for want of a message the battle was lost; for want of a battle the war was lost; for want of the war the kingdom was lost; and all for the want of a horseshoe nail. … and this reminds me the Game of Life, chaos theory, and Tolstoy’s integral metaphor from War…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/14/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"October 14th, 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-10-14; A Wind in the Door; relativity; interconnectivity","date":"2021-10-14","lastupdated":"2021-10-14","topics":["journal","life update","childhood","the Crisis","interconnectivity"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"childhood"}},

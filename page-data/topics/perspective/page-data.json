It started in the fields. She almost could have missed the whole event, prancing in the meadow\nas she was; one in her position could not help but gaze in upward bliss at the hues of saffron and\nrose and lavender that bloomed across the setting skies. She leapt up with glee, relishing in how\nthe gentle plush of the grass caught her fall and seemed to propel her ever higher and higher and\nhigher, oblivious to the fine trails of ash that lay in her wake. Just as she was about to burst into\na full gallop with the immensity of it all, she—and this was her folly—glanced down upon herself,\npromptly stumbling over her two left feet. She landed flat on her face with a muted thump! and a grayish puff swept a cloud of particulates\ninto her eyes and her mouth. For a moment, all she could manage to do was lie in a daze.

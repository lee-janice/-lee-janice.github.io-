After a long bout of mental anguish and intense contemplation regarding myself, my memories, my relationships, and my place in the grand scheme of the universe, I’ve come to the conclusion that the concept of a unified, cohesive self may very well be illusory, and that accepting myself as everchanging and interconnected potential rather than trying to cram the totality of who I am into a concrete, fixed reality does wonders for my wellbeing. That being said, the concept of myself still exists, floating around in the ambient space of consciousness.\nI created this document to capture some of those concepts.\nI hope that it will lend itself to a picture in your mind of who I am or who I was at some point in time.\nHowever, I do have trouble describing myself (see above), so if you really want to get to know me, contact me! ☺ “Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle.”  — Lewis Carroll; Alice in Wonderland   Where have I been and what have I done?  Where am I and what am I doing? This is a good question, and a hard one to respond to.\nI have no idea what I’m doing most of the time.\nIn terms of major life events, I’m currently residing in Los Angeles, recovering from a major existential crisis that occurred shortly after my undergraduate graduation, and am now applying to jobs!\nI’m interviewing for a technical research analyst position at the NYU-hosted Research Alliance for NYC Schools.\nFingers crossed!  What do I like? Dogen-zenji said, “Although everything has Buddha nature, we love flowers, and we do not care for weeds.” This is true of human nature. But that we are attached  to  some beauty is itself Buddha’s  activity.  That we do not care for weeds is also Buddha’s activity. We should know that.  If you know that, it is all right to attach to something.  If it is Buddha’s attachment, that is non-attachment.  So in love  there should be hate, or non-attachment.  And in hate there should be love, or acceptance.  Love and hate are one thing.  — Shunryu Suzuki; Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind  In short, I like everything.\nWhat’s not to love about the miracles of the universe, whether conventionally good or bad?\nBut while I do like everything, I am particularly fond of certain things.\nHere are some of those things. Current interests In light of my aforementioned existential crisis, I’ve awakened a huge…","fields":{"slug":"/about-me/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-09-18","title":"About me.","subtitle":"Information about me; what I'm up to now; current interests and favorites; major influences; how to contact me"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"This website  has been simmering in my mind since I first began programming in 2018.\nOne of the first projects that I wanted to complete after my first programming course was the creation of a personal website, but there were numerous psychological barriers that stood in the way of its birth — perfectionism, lack of confidence in my programming and writing capabilities, decision paralysis with respect to organization, form, and design — all of your classic self-sabatoging mentalities.\nBut one day, riding on the coattails of my existential crisis-fueled euphoria (or as some would say, delusion), I woke up and declared “F@$*, I’m just going to send it!”.\nAnd send it I did, and herein lies the product of that sending. In the remainder of this page, I’ll describe the overarching structure of my website, its intended purpose, the philosophy and inspiration for its content and design, and the technology behind the scenes.  Structure I’ve settled on a tripartite structure, although this may shift down the line as my needs and wants for this website change.\nThe three components are as follows:  Blog  — opinion-based essays, containing a more thorough analysis of chosen topics and the interweaving of various themes  Article  — information-based text, similar to a Wikipedia article or encyclopedia entry  Journal  — my personal thought/word/content vomit receptacle, containing the various brain farts and questions that pop into my head at random and the large or small moments from my day that I’d like to remember Every page under each of these branches will be tagged, and these tags will serve as the operator to link the three together.\nThe concepts identified in these tags can be perused in the Topics page, where you can see all of the posts pertaining to a particular topic. I hope that these three components will serve to encourage the flow and growth of information from a seed to a flourishing plant to a whole meal.\nMy vision is that the seeds of thought will be planted in my journal, where there is no pressure to have a coherent opinion or view on anything — just small beginnings.\nFrom the journal, I can cherry-pick interesting topics and do more in-depth research, posting the fruits of my labor as an article.\nThen, from the research in the articles, and other random tid-bits from my journal, I can weave it together into the grand feast of a blog post.\nWe’ll see if this strategy pans out, but I have high hopes!

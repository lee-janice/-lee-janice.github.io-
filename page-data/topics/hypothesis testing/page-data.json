The chi-squared test can only be used on categorical (i.e., nominal, discrete) data — so yes to the number of people in a certain gender, race/ethnicity, or political category, but no to heights, weights, lengths (unless you discretize your data first).\nUnlike other common hypothesis tests like the t-test, the chi-squared test is non-parametric, meaning that it does not rely on assumptions about the distribution of the data.\nInstead, it measures whether the data is likely to be drawn from a given distribution. The chi-squared test statistic has many talents—it can be used (i.e., interpreted) in numerous ways, such as: the chi-squared test of homogeneity, the chi-squared test of independence, and the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, the mechanisms of which will be shortly discussed.  A Motivating Example Let’s say that we have gotten our curious hands on a dataset that consists of a random sample of two groups of people,  and .\nFor each observation in our dataset, we have information on whether that person has certain attributes — let’s call them  and .\nWe may choose to summarize this data in a table like this: where  is the number of people in group  that have attribute .\nA natural and solid thing for a wandering mind to consider at this point is: are the two groups different (with respect to the two attributes)?\nOr are they similar?\nWhat a loaded question! Let’s suppose for a second that the two groups are similar.\nThen, we would expect that the probability for a person to have a certain attribute is the same, regardless of what group they are in.\nWe don’t know what the true probabilities are (or we wouldn’t need to ask these questions at all!), so let’s make an educated guess given the data that we have.\nWe will use Given these probabilities, we can calculate the number of people that we might expect to see with a given group/attribute combination.\nLet’s give a more concrete example here: Suppose that the probability of a person having attribute  is .\nIf there are  people in group , how many people would we expect to see in group  that have attribute ?

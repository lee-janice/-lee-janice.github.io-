T.) Suzuki (1870-1966) brought Zen to the West (with a focus on satori, or enlightenment), and fifty years later, Shunryū Suzuki (1904-1971) did similarly, but with less focus on satori. On preparing his students for his death, he said: If when I die, the moment I’m dying, if I suffer that is all\nright, you know; that is suffering Buddha. No confusion\nin it. Maybe everyone will struggle because of the physical\nagony or spiritual agony, too. But that is all right, that is\nnot a problem. We should be very grateful to have a\nlimited body…like mine, or like yours. If you had a\nlimitless life it would be a real problem for you. Introduction Zen mind is a phrase used by teachers to invoke the purpose of Zen in their students: “to make you wonder and to answer that wondering with the deepest expression of your own nature.”\nTo practice Zen mind is beginner’s mind (shoshin), or the “innocence of the first inquiry—what am I”?\nThe beginner’s mind is: free of habits and expectations ready to accept and doubt “the kind of mind which can see things as they are, which step-by-step and in a flash can realize the original nature of everything.” The editing and translation of this book is nuanced: Shunryū tries to convey teachings in terms of the ordinary circumstances of people’s lives, in statements as simple as “have a cup of tea,” which may be accidentally edited out.\nFurthermore, English is a dualistic language, whereas Japanese lends itself more to non-dualistic thinking. This book is divided into 3 sections, which are: Right Practice (pertaining to the body) Right Attitude (pertaining to feelings) Right Understanding (pertaining to the mind) On the relationship between Zen teacher and student: A roshi is a person who has actualized that perfect freedom which\nis the potentiality for all human beings. He exists freely in the\nfullness of his whole being. The flow of his consciousness is not the\nfixed repetitive patterns of our usual self-centered consciousness, but\nrather arises spontaneously and naturally from the actual\ncircumstances of the present. … But in the end it is not the extraordinariness\nof the teacher which perplexes, intrigues, and deepens the student, it is the\nteacher’s utter ordinariness. Because he is just himself, he is a mirror\nfor his students. When we are with him we feel our own strengths\nand shortcomings without any sense of praise or criticism from him.\nIn his presence we see our original face, and the…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/essays/spirituality/suzuki-shunryu-zen-mind-beginners-mind/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Suzuki, Shunryū; Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind (1970)","subtitle":"Notes on Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryū Suzuki","date":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","lectures","zen","buddhism","mindfulness"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/spirituality/nhat-hahn-thich-the-miracle-of-mindfulness/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nhat Hahn, Thich; The Miracle of Mindfulness","subtitle":"Notes on The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hahn","date":"2022-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","buddhism","thich nhat hahn","mindfulness","religion"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"mindfulness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

This process is three-fold: (1) new material is anchored to\nrelevant preexisting concepts, (2) the two interact to produce new meanings, and (3) the new meanings are connected\nto their anchoring concepts. Central to his theory is this notion of cognitive structure, or the hierarchically-organized\nframework of knowledge that serves as an anchoring site for new ideas. To Ausubel, the availability, stability, clarity,\nand discriminability of concepts in cognitive structure are the principal factors influencing meaningful learning. One hypothesis resulting from this claim predicts that meaningful learning more readily occurs if one’s cognitive\nstructure is clear, stable, and well-organized than if it is vague, unreliable, or disordered (Ausubel, 1968, 2000). This\nhypothesis has been put to the test through studies of Ausubel’s (1960) advance organizers (AOs), with the\nfundamental conjecture being that the organizer provides an anchoring structure for the incorporation of new ideas and\nthus facilitates meaningful learning. The initial outlook for this hypothesis was favorable: in his inaugural paper on\nAOs, Ausubel (1960) reported that undergraduate students who received an expository AO on metallurgy\noutperformed those who were administered a historical passage on the same topic. Four subsequent studies demonstrated\nsimilar results in favor of AOs (Ausubel & Fitzgerald, 1961, 1962; Fitzgerald & Ausbel, 1963; Ausubel & Youssef, 1965). However, as the body of research on the subject expanded, an increasing number of studies failed to replicate\nthese outcomes. In a notable meta-analysis of the research, Barnes & Clawson (1975) found that in 20 of the 32 studies\nunder their review, AOs did not produce significant results. They ultimately concluded that “advance organizers, as\npresently constructed, generally do not facilitate learning” (p. 651). These remarks provoked a lively meta-analytic\ndefense of AOs in which numerous other authors not only noted that in the studies under their review, significant\nresults outnumbered non-significant ones, but also suggested that Barnes & Clawson had failed to adequately judge\nthe implications of Ausubel’s theory for learning outcomes and that their methodology of meta-analysis was\nsuspect (Mayer, 1979a, 1979b; Lawton & Wanska, 1977; Stone, 1983; Luiten et…","fields":{"slug":"/essays/psychology/towards-a-cccm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Towards a collaboratively-constructed conceptual map","subtitle":"A potential application of Ausubel’s assimilation theory","date":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["essays","psychology","education","learning","assimilation-theory","ausubel"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"ausubel"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

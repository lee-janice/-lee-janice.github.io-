A conundrum that I am contemplating today is the problem of habituation with respect to eating food.\nIt’s an unfortunate side effect of human physiology that your taste buds habituate to the flavor of the food that you’re eating.\nWell, perhaps it’s not a mere side effect: I can imagine the havoc that I would wreck on my body if I never habituated to the flavor of sweets, for instance.\nHowever, I still think it quite unfortunate that in the course of eating a daily meal, the actual tasting of it gets diminished over and over again: sometimes when I eat, I end up barely tasting the food at all.\nIs there a way to prevent this phenomenon from occurring?\nWe have palette cleansers and the like, but I wonder if there’s a way to avoid this desensitization with the mind alone.\nIs this a battle where willpower can triumph over the body? The reason why I’m interested in the answer to this question is that this situation seems to me to be a microcosm of the myriad of ways that desensitization plagues our lives.\nHow much of the richness of life are we missing merely because we are accustomed to the way that things are?\nWhat of the miraculous nature of existence, its taste and truth and suchness, are we forgoing because of our iniquities and the faults in the human constitution?\nHow can we expand our minds and our hearts and savor each and every moment of our lives? A slight tangent, but this line of thought reminds me of this quote that I came upon while reading the Wikipedia page on praxis: Wisdom is always taste—in both Latin and Hebrew, the word for wisdom comes from the word for taste—so it’s something…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/14/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 14th, 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-14; youth and longing; habituation; tasting life; attention; a dissonant existence","date":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["journal","youth","habituation","attention","cognitive dissonance","alice in wonderland"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"attention"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

Do they experience loneliness? Is there ever a moment in a bird’s lifetime when they feel outcast by their fellow feathered folk and they can’t find a single thing — nary a single branch — in this world to lean or rest upon? What do they do in those moments? How do they go on? Or are they contented with searching the skies for yet another seed to peck at? This notion sounds ridiculous, but I wonder if our experiences (birds, humans) are more similar than one may initially imagine. This morning, I saw a female sparrow (well, they aren’t really sparrows, but I’ve forgotten the correct name for them) nip at the feathers of a male, vying for his attention. A bird’s equivalent of flirtatious pursuit, I presume. It made me dream about the microcosm of the bird’s love life — on their scale, are there gestures as subtle as a blush, a stolen glance, or a light caress on another’s shoulders? Do they exist, only to be imperceptible to the naïve human’s eye? I spent a bit of time attempting to recall the word for the study of putting oneself in the animal’s shoes (or rather, hide? perhaps this is too grotesque), and after a few moments of contemplation, the word flashed into my mind. Ethology. This spark of cognition made me question how it is that we experience these types of “revelatory” thoughts. What happens in the brain when we attempt to recall something that is on the tip of our tongue? How do we suddenly come to connecting the dots? In this particular instance, I knew that the word began with the letter “E,” and that it was the title of a lecture video on human behavioral biology that I am currently watching. I knew that one such word that fit into this category was “Endocrinology,” but I knew that it wasn’t what I was searching for. But the harder I tried to remember, the more the word seemed to evade me, until I decided to put it on the back burner of my mind. I entrusted the task to my future self, thinking “it’ll come to me later,” and not five seconds had passed until it popped into my brain. But what had happened? I wasn’t actively thinking about the word. My mind had already jumped to another object of consideration. What was my brain doing without me knowing? It’s clear that there are an uncountable number of cognitive processes that occur simultaneously in our brain, a vast majority of them outside of the realm of conscious perception. It reminds me of what Thich Nhat Hahn mentions in The Sun My…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 10th, 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-10; a bird's love life; cognition; a slight descent into madness","date":"2022-04-10","lastupdated":"2022-04-10","topics":["journal","cognition","loneliness","uncertainty"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"uncertainty"}},

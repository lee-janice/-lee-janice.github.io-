But even in my mindlessness, I happened to lock eyes with a girl leaning up against the backrest of a park bench.\nTight black coils bounced from her head, and a fitted army-green top with short sleeves and loose black jeans dressed her small frame.\nWith her left hand and a bent elbow she held a up a smoking joint.\nWhen our gazes met, a slight smile bloomed on her lips, her free hand shot up into the air, and she gave me a tiny yet eager wave.\nAlthough small, her gesture was imbued with the intimacy of a dear friend, not the hesitancy of a stranger.

I had another provoking encounter yesterday at Union Square Park.\nI had just bought eight bundles of daffodils from a stand at the farmer’s market (their fragrance was divine), and I plopped onto a park bench in contentment with my purchase.\nWithin a few moments of me finding my rest, a scraggly-haired man dragged a Citi bike laboriously to the bench on my left and made his seat there.\nHe had the appearance of a wanderer: a lanky frame, a long and sun-weathered face, and craggly yellow teeth.\nI don’t mean this statement in jest, but something in his demeanor evoked that of a mouse or rat-like creature…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/17/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"April 17th, 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-17; two encounters; impermanence and beauty","date":"2022-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["journal","impermanence"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"impermanence"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

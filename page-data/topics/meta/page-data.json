In the remainder of this page, I’ll describe the overarching structure of my website, its intended purpose, the philosophy and inspiration for its content and design, and the technology behind the scenes.  Structure I’ve settled on a tripartite structure, although this may shift down the line as my needs and wants for this website change.\nThe three components are as follows:  Essays  — opinion-based, longer-form content, containing a more thorough analysis of chosen topics and the interweaving of various themes  Notes  — information-based text, similar to a Wikipedia article or encyclopedia entry, or other more comprehensive notes on a specific topic  Journal  — my personal thought/word/content vomit receptacle, containing the various brain farts and questions that pop into my head at random and the large or small moments from my day that I’d like to remember Every page under each of these branches will be tagged, and these tags will serve as the operator to link the three together.\nThe concepts identified in these tags can be perused in the Topics page, where you can see all of the posts pertaining to a particular topic. I hope that these three components will serve to encourage the flow and growth of information from a seed to a flourishing plant to a whole meal.\nMy vision is that the seeds of thought will be planted in my journal, where there is no pressure to have a coherent opinion or view on anything — just small beginnings.\nFrom the journal, I can cherry-pick interesting topics and do more in-depth research, posting the fruits of my labor as a note.\nThen, from the research in the notes, and other random tid-bits from my journal, I can weave it together into the grand feast of an essay.\nWe’ll see if this strategy pans out, but I have high…","fields":{"slug":"/about-this-site/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"About this site.","subtitle":"Information about this site; the structure, purpose, philosophy, and inspiration; implementation details; to-dos","date":"2021-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2021-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["meta"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"meta"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

To teach and to learn are acts that shape not only the individual human experience, but also the whole spirit of humanity: the understanding that we gain in our lifetime and that which we pass on to the next are like threads weaving the past, present, and future of our species together. I believe that the threads of knowledge are as vital to the human condition as those gossamer strands that constitute our genetic code. Yet, the importance of education lies in stark contrast to its position in the cultural milieu. Education—particularly at the K-12 level—is continuously dismissed, defunded, and degraded, and the reverberations of the past few years have made it seem as though the educational system is arriving at critical mass. It feels like we are swaying on the precipice of great change. There is hope in this change. Where systems may stumble, humanity stands strong. We are, each of us, unwavering bands of light flashing into the vast phenomenal world; we possess, each of us, the sun of our awareness and the kingdom of heaven within. We are precious in the cosmic perspective. The question then becomes: can this be realized in a system of education? Can we actualize ourselves and each other through our pedagogies? Shunryū Suzuki; Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind Funkadelic; Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts To investigate these questions, I propose the following concentration: Pedagogical Praxis: Theory, Process, and Practice. This concentration is rooted in the Freirean conception of praxis, which he defines in Pedagogy of the Oppressed as “reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.” This definition is paramount. Reflection sans action would be mere speculation, and action sans reflection would be mere folly. I believe that it is the dialectic between the two that can give rise to true radical change. A central question to consider, then, is how can—and how should—we change? In order to propose an answer, we should recall an idea as old as time itself: to know where to go from here, we must invariably look to where we have been. This is the forte of the fields of history and philosophy. I suggest that any inquiry would be incomplete without a voyage into either. I thus offer Theory as the contemplation of the philosophical, cultural, and societal underpinnings of the current educational practice. Through the disciplines of philosophy, history, and the social sciences, I hope to trace the…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/personal/nyu-gallatin-personal-statement/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Education as reflection and action","subtitle":"My (rejected) statement of purpose for the Master's program at NYU Gallatin","date":"2023-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["essays","education","praxis"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"education"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

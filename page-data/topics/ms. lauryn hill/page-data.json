I was looking at my eyes in the bathroom of Coffee Connection, and I realized that they have the same shape as the eyes on the cover of my edition of The Trial… ☹ reminds me of A telling me that I have “crazy eyes”… ☹  Saw something very dystopian-reminiscent today:  What the f? This billboard FORCES you to look at it, since it extends halfway across the freakin’ street.\nHow is this legal? This is one of those LED/digital billboards that have been popping up everywhere as of late. The ad before this one was BRIGHT blue and yellow and was extremely distracting on the road — could you imagine what this would look like at night?\nHow terrifying is it that advertising agencies and urban planners or whoever is responsible for this atrocity would perpetuate consumerism a manner that jeopardizes the safety of drivers?\nThis is horrifying to me. Other random thoughts: saw a black butterfly with white winged tips today while playing ball with Darla, reminds me of catching butterflies in childhood and how the bushes seemed so tall then","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/01/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"October 1st, 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-10-01; more thoughts on The Trial; connections to Mystery of Iniquity by Ms. Lauryn Hill","date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["journal","the trial","kafka, franz","ms. lauryn hill"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"ms. lauryn hill"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

To the dirt you belong, not sky, nor tree,\nand whispers turn truth in one’s own esteem,\nbut solace does lie in the certainty!\nHide from the light, enjoy filth’s regime!\nAnd through one’s beady eyes, though beetled be,\nthis life still does seem a Beauty supreme.","fields":{"slug":"/notes/writing/the-fall/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Fall","subtitle":"A roach in shallow guise","date":"2024-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2024-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["writing","poetry","fear","uncertainty"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"fear"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

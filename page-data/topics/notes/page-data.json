Mumon’s Commentary If anyone can open one eye at this point and say a word of Zen, he is qualified to repay the four gratifications, and, not only that, he can save all sentient beings under him.\nBut if he cannot say such a word of Zen, he should turn back to his tail. Mumon’s Poem  The Short Staff Kōan Shuzan held out his short staff and said: “If you call this a short staff, you oppose its reality.\nIf you do not call it a short staff, you ignore the fact.\nNow what do you wish to call this?” Mumon’s Commentary If you call this a short staff, you oppose its reality.\nIf you do not call it a short staff, you ignore the fact.\nIt cannot be expressed with words and it cannot be expressed without words.\nNow say quickly what it is. Mumon’s Poem  The Reflected Moon Chiyono studied Zen for many years under Bukkō of Engaku.\nStill, she could not attain the fruits of meditation.\nAt last one moonlight night she was carrying water in an old wooden pail girded with bamboo.\nThe bamboo broke, and the bottom fell out of the pail.\nAt that moment, she was set free.\nChiyono said, “No more water in the pail, no more moon in the water.”","fields":{"slug":"/notes/misc/koans/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A collection of kōans","subtitle":"Kōans that I find thought-provoking","date":"2022-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","zen","buddhism"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Lecture 1: Introduction to Human Behavioral Biology Humans use conceptual “buckets” in order to operate within the world.\nThese buckets allow us to simplify and understand the world, but using this type of categorical thinking comes with some pitfalls: People tend to underestimate differences between two things in the same conceptual bucket (we call two shades of red “red,” but other cultures may call them something different). People tend to overestimate the difference between two things with a boundary between them (we call one color “red” and another “violet,” when in reality they are closer in color than two shades of “red”). When people focus on categorical thinking, they lose out on the bigger picture. No single bucket provides the Ultimate Explanation: they are all necessary for a complete understanding of any system (in this case, biology and behavior). So, we should not fall for thinking that one bucket is the key to the answer. Sapolosky offers three quotes that demonstrate the dangers of falling into a one-bucket mindset: John Watson, the father of behaviorism Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I’ll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select—doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. Egas Moniz, on frontal lobotomies Normal psychic life depends upon the good functioning of brain synapses, and mental disorders appear as a result of synaptic derangements. Synaptic adjustments will then modify the corresponding ideas and force them into different channels. Using this approach we obtain cures and improvements but no failures. Konrad Lorenz, a founding father of ethology and a Nazi propagandist The selection for toughness, heroism, social utility…must be accomplished by some human institution if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy. In the remainder of the course, the intellectual challenge will be to not fall into categorical thinking, to continually assume and then abandon each conceptual bucket. We have to realize the following: There are circumstances in which we are like every other animal. One example is the McClintock effect, which is the synchronization of female menstrual cycles when in close proximity. There are other circumstances in…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/lectures/sapolosky-robert-human-behavioral-biology/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sapolosky, Robert; Human Behavioral Biology","subtitle":"Notes on Robert Sapolosky's lecture series on human behavioral biology","date":"2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","lectures","biology","evolution"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/religion/nhat-hahn-thich-the-miracle-of-mindfulness/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nhat Hahn, Thich; The Miracle of Mindfulness","subtitle":"Notes on The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hahn","date":"2022-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","buddhism","thich nhat hahn","mindfulness","religion"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/kafka-franz-the-trial/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kafka, Franz; The Trial","subtitle":"Notes on The Trial by Franz Kafka, translated by Breon Mitchell","date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","the trial","kafka, franz","philosophy","absurdism"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/carroll-lewis-alice-in-wonderland/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Carroll, Lewis; Alice in Wonderland","subtitle":"Notes on Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll","date":"2022-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","lewis carroll","alice in wonderland","fantasy"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"notes"}},

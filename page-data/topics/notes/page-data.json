People tend to overestimate the difference between two things with a boundary between them (we call one color “red” and another “violet,” when in reality they are closer in color than two shades of “red”). When people focus on categorical thinking, they lose out on the bigger picture. No single bucket provides the Ultimate Explanation: they are all necessary for a complete understanding of any system (in this case, biology and behavior). So, we should not fall for thinking that one bucket is the key to the answer. Sapolosky offers three quotes that demonstrate the dangers of falling into a one-bucket mindset: John Watson, the father of behaviorism Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I’ll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select—doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. Egas Moniz, on frontal lobotomies Normal psychic life depends upon the good functioning of brain synapses, and mental disorders appear as a result of synaptic derangements. Synaptic adjustments will then modify the corresponding ideas and force them into different channels. Using this approach we obtain cures and improvements but no failures. Konrad Lorenz, a founding father of ethology and a Nazi propagandist The selection for toughness, heroism, social utility…must be accomplished by some human institution if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy. In the remainder of the course, the intellectual challenge will be to not fall into categorical thinking, to continually assume and then abandon each conceptual bucket. We have to realize the following: There are circumstances in which we are like every other animal. One example is the McClintock effect, which is the synchronization of female menstrual cycles when in close proximity.

T.) Suzuki (1870-1966) brought Zen to the West (with a focus on satori, or enlightenment), and fifty years later, Shunryū Suzuki (1904-1971) did similarly, but with less focus on satori. On preparing his students for his death, he said: If when I die, the moment I’m dying, if I suffer that is all\nright, you know; that is suffering Buddha. No confusion\nin it. Maybe everyone will struggle because of the physical\nagony or spiritual agony, too. But that is all right, that is\nnot a problem. We should be very grateful to have a\nlimited body…like mine, or like yours. If you had a\nlimitless life it would be a real problem for you. Introduction Zen mind is a phrase used by teachers to invoke the purpose of Zen in their students: “to make you wonder and to answer that wondering with the deepest expression of your own nature.”\nTo practice Zen mind is beginner’s mind (shoshin), or the “innocence of the first inquiry—what am I”?\nThe beginner’s mind is: free of habits and expectations ready to accept and doubt “the kind of mind which can see things as they are, which step-by-step and in a flash can realize the original nature of everything.” The editing and translation of this book is nuanced: Shunryū tries to convey teachings in terms of the ordinary circumstances of people’s lives, in statements as simple as “have a cup of tea,” which may be accidentally edited out.\nFurthermore, English is a dualistic language, whereas Japanese lends itself more to non-dualistic thinking. This book is divided into 3 sections, which are: Right Practice (pertaining to the body) Right Attitude (pertaining to feelings) Right Understanding (pertaining to the mind) On the relationship between Zen teacher and student: A roshi is a person who has actualized that perfect freedom which\nis the potentiality for all human beings. He exists freely in the\nfullness of his whole being. The flow of his consciousness is not the\nfixed repetitive patterns of our usual self-centered consciousness, but\nrather arises spontaneously and naturally from the actual\ncircumstances of the present. … But in the end it is not the extraordinariness\nof the teacher which perplexes, intrigues, and deepens the student, it is the\nteacher’s utter ordinariness. Because he is just himself, he is a mirror\nfor his students. When we are with him we feel our own strengths\nand shortcomings without any sense of praise or criticism from him.\nIn his presence we see our original face, and the…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/essays/spirituality/suzuki-shunryu-zen-mind-beginners-mind/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Suzuki, Shunryū; Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind (1970)","subtitle":"Notes on Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryū Suzuki","date":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","lectures","zen","buddhism","mindfulness"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/spirituality/nhat-hahn-thich-the-miracle-of-mindfulness/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nhat Hahn, Thich; The Miracle of Mindfulness","subtitle":"Notes on The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hahn","date":"2022-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","buddhism","thich nhat hahn","mindfulness","religion"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1950-1999/vonnegut-kurt-breakfast-of-champions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vonnegut Jr., Kurt; Breakfast of Champions (1973)","subtitle":"Notes on Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.","date":"2023-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","kurt vonnegut","metafiction","kilgore trout","science fiction","free will","schizophrenia","solipsism","irony"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1950-1999/vonnegut-kurt-cats-cradle/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vonnegut Jr., Kurt; Cat's Cradle (1963)","subtitle":"Notes on Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.","date":"2023-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","kurt vonnegut","science fiction","irony","science","religion"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1950-1999/vonnegut-kurt-slaughterhouse-five/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vonnegut Jr., Kurt; Slaughterhouse-Five (1969)","subtitle":"Notes on Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.","date":"2022-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","kurt vonnegut","slaughterhouse-five","war","world war ii","time","science fiction","irony"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1950-1999/vonnegut-kurt-the-sirens-of-titan/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vonnegut Jr., Kurt; The Sirens of Titan (1959)","subtitle":"Notes on The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.","date":"2023-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2023-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","kurt vonnegut","science fiction","purpose"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1900-1949/kafka-franz-the-trial/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kafka, Franz; The Trial (1915)","subtitle":"Notes on The Trial by Franz Kafka, translated by Breon Mitchell","date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","the trial","kafka, franz","philosophy","absurdism"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1800s/carroll-lewis-alice-in-wonderland/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Carroll, Lewis; Alice in Wonderland (1865)","subtitle":"Notes on Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll","date":"2022-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","lewis carroll","alice in wonderland","fantasy"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/novels/1900-1949/kafka-franz-investigations-of-a-dog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kafka, Franz; Investigations of a Dog (1922)","subtitle":"Notes on Investigations of a Dog by Franz Kafka","date":"2022-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","lastupdated":"2022-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","topics":["notes","investigations of a dog","kafka, franz","philosophy","absurdism"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"notes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"]}

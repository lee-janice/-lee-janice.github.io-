That’s all we are, but we’re smart enough to realize that before ordering such an arrest the higher authorities who employ us inform themselves in great detail about the person they’re arresting and the grounds for the arrest. There’s been no mistake.   Dialogue from guard to K.; chapter 1 (Arrest), page 8; importance: 4  The inspector cries out as if he has to wake me up, practically shouting; unfortunately I’ll have to shout too, to show you how it was; all he shouts is his name, by the way.

But then, annoyed once more by the futility of the whole enterprise, he returned and knocked at the first door on the fifth floor.  chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), page 41; importance: 4  K. let him lead the way; it turned out that there was indeed a narrow path free through the swirling crowd, one that possibly divided two parties; this possibility was further supported by the fact that K. saw scarcely a face turned toward him in the closest rows on his left and right, but merely the backs of people addressing their words and gestures solely to those in their own party.  chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), page 42; importance: 4  “Your question, Your Honor, about my being a house painter — and you weren’t really asking at all, you were telling me outright — is characteristic of the way these entire proceedings against me are being conducted. You may object that these aren’t proceedings at all, and you’re certainly right there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such… what has happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I don’t take it very seriously, but it is typical…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/books/fiction/absurdism/kafka-franz-the-trial/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-10-01","title":"Kafka, Franz; The Trial","subtitle":"Notes on The Trial by Franz Kafka, translated by Breon Mitchell","topics":["notes","the trial","kafka, franz","philosophy","absurdism"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"2021-10-06 dream flew to san francisco and went biking and out of the park there was this super steep hill and by the end it was almost vertical and there were 3 bikers behind me (2 guys 1 girl) who made it up w their bikes and i was hanging vertically on the street and finally made it up and they told me not to take a shower here bc the showers are gross and the second guy told me i looked extremely beautiful then i checked google maps and i was really far from where i wanted to be (looked like prospect park on gmaps, but i was way south) and i saw this golden lighted village to my right (north east) and i went there and rode up some stairs and an asian couple said that they didnt know what they were doing here and i woke up  2021-09-23 dream about mom and Kanye west and building with old Korean lady giving massage and something rly scary was happening and the same woman/man were appearing everywhere and I had to run away  2021-09-10 dream about climbing table rock and having been there before and streets were flooding and crying after shower with dad and subway sandwiches with white guy  2021-08-04 dream where A was in it and he was walking w his friend talking Abt hs classes and I followed them and somehow we all stopped and his friend started glowing light and I started vibrating really really fast and I turned to A to ask if he saw his friend glowing and he said no\ncontinuation of dream, driving in the mountains and it was nighttime and saw this guy w dog attached to his chest w a leash, and something about mapping some human emotions to a topology and the results corresponding w some skeleton (hip bone) of ancient ppl I had in the backseat of my car, and someone else was in my car, and he said good job look what you’ve done w ur potential, and I said we are our potential, and he said yes… that’s what they want me to say and lunged at me (right lower abdomen)  2021-08-04 dream about visiting new York and going to grand central station and forgot my luggage at the main terminal but there was this rollercoaster that I went on without realizing (everything was really dark) and arcade and coldstone  2021-07-24 dream about vacation on a place along the coast and there was a temple slash house thing with lots of pictures on the wall and the first floor was like a dojo or something and A met me there but then my mom and sister came and then he disappeared and then switched to this other place with a house and mom said she wasnt going to support me anymore…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/personal/dream-journal/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-10-03","title":"Dream journal","subtitle":"A log of my more memorable dreams in reverse-chronological order","topics":["notes","dreams","personal","liminality","subconscious"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Currently X-ing Reading: Douglas Hofstader; Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid Listening: N/A Watching: N/A  Books Madeline L’Engle; A Wind in the Door Hermann Hesse; Siddhartha Kurt Vonnegut; Slaughterhouse Five  Essays and letters Turing, Alan; Computing Machinery and Intelligence Kafka, Franz; Letter to My Father Woolf, Virginia; A Room of One’s Own  Albums or artists Al Green Stevie Wonder  Movies Charlie Kaufman; Synecdoche, New York Wong Kar-wai; In the Mood for Love Studio Ghibli; Grave of the Fireflies Studio Ghibli; The Cat Returns Studio Ghibli; The Secret World of Arrietty  TV shows or anime Hideaki Anno; Neon Genesis Evangelion","fields":{"slug":"/notes/personal/content-consumption-queue/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-10-04","title":"Content consumption queue","subtitle":"A note to keep track of what I should read/watch/listen to next","topics":["notes"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"notes"}},

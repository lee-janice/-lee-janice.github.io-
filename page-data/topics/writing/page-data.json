It started in the fields. She almost could have missed the whole event, prancing in the meadow\nas she was; one in her position could not help but gaze in upward bliss at the hues of saffron and\nrose and lavender that bloomed across the setting skies. She leapt up with glee, relishing in how\nthe gentle plush of the grass caught her fall and seemed to propel her ever higher and higher and\nhigher, oblivious to the fine trails of ash that lay in her wake. Just as she was about to burst into\na full gallop with the immensity of it all, she—and this was her folly—glanced down upon herself,\npromptly stumbling over her two left feet. She landed flat on her face with a muted thump! and a grayish puff swept a cloud of particulates\ninto her eyes and her mouth. For a moment, all she could manage to do was lie in a daze. The sky\ntumbled and churned in great circles overhead. In the still of her stupor, the dust finally settled to\nthe earth—and only then did she attempt to blindly grasp around her for some bare modicum of\nsense. She tore up a clenched fist full of grass-blades and splayed it open to a poof. Her spine stiffened and she shot upwards in shock. She could now see clearly the ripples of soot\nthat streaked her wayward path through the field. She hobbled to her feet, with a half-hope that\nthe higher vantage point would dispel the irregular scene, but the only thing she now grasped was\njust how deeply the blemished veins ran. She began to feel a chill. In the dying light, she could spot others in the distance—a couple\nintertwined, a flock of friends in celebration, a child and a dog—but she could detect in none of their\nsilhouettes any sign of the icy panic that now inched and nestled deep into her bones.      What’s happening to me? She fled, homeward bound, not daring to glance down at the clouds of dust that smoked from her\nstaggering gait. She collapsed against her doorway, fumbling with the lock, and finally broke into\nthe room with a haggard leap. She turned and barricaded the door, one, two, three, and shuttered\nthe blinds in a vehement clap. By now it was night, her room cold and pitch black. She couldn’t bring herself to flip on the ceiling\nlight, fearing the scene that it might reveal, and instead lit a candle with a match and a hissss. The\nflame flickered precariously. Overcome by a morbid curiosity, she peered into a mirror. A distorted figure leered back.

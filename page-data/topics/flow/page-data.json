For various reasons, I hold a concerning amount of tension in my body:\nwhenever I write with a pencil or pen, I grip the barrel so firmly that my hand begins to cramp far too quickly and a permanent writer’s bump has grown on the left side of my middle finger;\nI tense my shoulders in any circumstance, even when carrying out a task of as little consequence as lifting a feather;\nmy teeth and jaw are often clenched as if I am bracing for some inevitable impact;\nand I am in the extremely poor habit of holding my breath when I lie deep — well, if I am honest, even shallow — in thought or action.\nThese and other habits of existential friction often accumulate into piercing headaches, knotted muscles, or other similar psychosomatic afflictions, of which I am unfortunately prone.\nMy theory is that this tension is, above all else, a symptom of a desperate floundering for control: I grasp at everything with such fervor and tightness because of a wretched paranoia of it slipping through my fingers and thus producing an outcome that I can neither predict nor prepare for.

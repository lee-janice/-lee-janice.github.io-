Well, in actuality, it was a multitude of dreams, but this particular one disturbed me.\nI only recall a single fragment of it. Someone was cooking a gargantuan purple fish on a gas stove.\nIts jaundiced, bulging eyes protruded from its head and its body was covered in yellowed spikes.\nMost nauseatingly, its mouth was stuffed with tentacles, colored with the same purple hue and littered with the same spikes as were on the rest of the body.\nThe person cooking the fish looked at me and then grabbed ahold of the tentacles and twisted them loose from the fish’s mouth.\nHe said “Here, I know you like this part” (of the fish) and laid the writhing mass on my plate.\nThat was all I remember. But when I woke up, I was extremely repulsed. I have my suspicions regarding the origin of this dream in my subconscious, which is why I decided to record it.\nEarlier this week, I bought some oxtails to make my favorite Korean comfort dish: ggori-gomtang.\nI don’t usually cook meat at home, but I’ve been wanting to make this soup for a while.\nHowever, when I was handling the meat, I was immediately overcome by an involuntary sense of revulsion.\nSomething about the texture of the flesh, the color of blood, the stringy tendons, the definition of the circles on the oxtail cartilage — I almost felt like throwing up. I made the soup, but that experience planted the seeds of guilt in my mind.\nI started to think about how there is no moral justification for the consumption of meat (outside of extenuating personal circumstances, of which I have none), and how I know this and yet still continue to eat it out of my own selfishness.\nI contemplated setting a hard and fast rule on not eating meat at home, but somehow this seemed worse to me than continuing to eat it both at home and out: at least now, I’m forced to be uncomfortable and think about the consequences of my actions.\nIf I allow myself to eat meat in restaurants, I’d be covering up my shame, ignoring the root of the moral issue, and yet I may think myself more moral by virtue of not eating meat at home.\nThings like this should not be left out of sight, out of mind. This experience made me think about a role that dreams often seem to play in one’s (or at least in my) brain: the role of the conscious.\nI was feeling guilty about cooking the oxtails but tried to downplay my guilt, and my dream hung it over me in an unforgettable symbolic form.\nNot to be heretical, but this makes me wonder if the stories…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/13/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-04-13","title":"April 13th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-13; a dream; guilt about eating meat","topics":["journal","dreams"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"2021-10-06 dream flew to san francisco and went biking and out of the park there was this super steep hill and by the end it was almost vertical and there were 3 bikers behind me (2 guys 1 girl) who made it up w their bikes and i was hanging vertically on the street and finally made it up and they told me not to take a shower here bc the showers are gross and the second guy told me i looked extremely beautiful then i checked google maps and i was really far from where i wanted to be (looked like prospect park on gmaps, but i was way south) and i saw this golden lighted village to my right (north east) and i went there and rode up some stairs and an asian couple said that they didnt know what they were doing here and i woke up  2021-09-23 dream about mom and Kanye west and building with old Korean lady giving massage and something rly scary was happening and the same woman/man were appearing everywhere and I had to run away  2021-09-10 dream about climbing table rock and having been there before and streets were flooding and crying after shower with dad and subway sandwiches with white guy  2021-08-04 dream where A was in it and he was walking w his friend talking Abt hs classes and I followed them and somehow we all stopped and his friend started glowing light and I started vibrating really really fast and I turned to A to ask if he saw his friend glowing and he said no\ncontinuation of dream, driving in the mountains and it was nighttime and saw this guy w dog attached to his chest w a leash, and something about mapping some human emotions to a topology and the results corresponding w some skeleton (hip bone) of ancient ppl I had in the backseat of my car, and someone else was in my car, and he said good job look what you’ve done w ur potential, and I said we are our potential, and he said yes… that’s what they want me to say and lunged at me (right lower abdomen)  2021-08-04 dream about visiting new York and going to grand central station and forgot my luggage at the main terminal but there was this rollercoaster that I went on without realizing (everything was really dark) and arcade and coldstone  2021-07-24 dream about vacation on a place along the coast and there was a temple slash house thing with lots of pictures on the wall and the first floor was like a dojo or something and A met me there but then my mom and sister came and then he disappeared and then switched to this other place with a house and mom said she wasnt going to support me anymore…","fields":{"slug":"/notes/personal/dream-journal/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-10-03","title":"Dream journal","subtitle":"A log of my more memorable dreams in reverse-chronological order","topics":["notes","dreams","personal","liminality","subconscious"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"topic":"dreams"}},

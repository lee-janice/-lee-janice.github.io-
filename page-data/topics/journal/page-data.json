Do they experience loneliness? Is there ever a moment in a bird’s lifetime when they feel outcast by their fellow feathered folk and they can’t find a single thing — nary a single branch — in this world to lean or rest upon? What do they do in those moments? How do they go on? Or are they contented with searching the skies for yet another seed to peck at? This notion sounds ridiculous, but I wonder if our experiences (birds, humans) are more similar than one may initially imagine. This morning, I saw a female sparrow (well, they aren’t really sparrows, but I’ve forgotten the correct name for them) nip at the feathers of a male, vying for his attention. A bird’s equivalent of flirtatious pursuit, I presume. It made me dream about the microcosm of the bird’s love life — on their scale, are there gestures as subtle as a blush, a stolen glance, or a light caress on another’s shoulders? Do they exist, only to be imperceptible to the naïve human’s eye? I spent a bit of time attempting to recall the word for the study of putting oneself in the animal’s shoes (or rather, hide? perhaps this is too grotesque), and after a few moments of contemplation, the word flashed into my mind. Ethology. This spark of cognition made me question how it is that we experience these types of “revelatory” thoughts. What happens in the brain when we attempt to recall something that is on the tip of our tongue? How do we suddenly come to connecting the dots? In this particular instance, I knew that the word began with the letter “E,” and that it was the title of a lecture video on human behavioral biology that I am currently watching. I knew that one such word that fit into this category was “Endocrinology,” but I knew that it wasn’t what I was searching for. But the harder I tried to remember, the more the word seemed to evade me, until I decided to put it on the back burner of my mind. I entrusted the task to my future self, thinking “it’ll come to me later,” and not five seconds had passed until it popped into my brain. But what had happened? I wasn’t actively thinking about the word. My mind had already jumped to another object of consideration. What was my brain doing without me knowing? It’s clear that there are an uncountable number of cognitive processes that occur simultaneously in our brain, a vast majority of them outside of the realm of conscious perception. It reminds me of what Thich Nhat Hahn mentions in The Sun My…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/10/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-04-10","title":"April 10th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-10; a bird's love life; cognition; a slight descent into madness","topics":["journal","cognition","loneliness","uncertainty"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Found a roommate, and we’re looking at apartments in Central Harlem — the one we’re applying to is amazingly beautiful.\nIncredibly high ceilings, which I feel like is rare for New York, tons of light, a community garden across the street (!), I’m very excited! Went to the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells with my mom this past weekend.\nBeing in the stands amongst the crowd is so much more exhilarating than watching on the television.\nFor some reason, I had the preconception that tennis was a “stuffy” sport live — I had the mental image of heads swiveling to the left and right in complete silence so as not to disturb the flow of the players.\nBut in reality, the crowd is invigorating.\nThere were cries of joy, uncontainable gasps of shock (when Andy Murray won via an underhand serve to take the first game of the second set!), and cheers of encouragement being sent towards the players.\nIt reminded me of the oneness of humanity and the emergent powers of camaraderie. Another thought crossed my mind while I was watching Andy Murray v. Carlos Alcaraz in Stadium 2.\nIt was an especially hot day, and the tournament organizers provided everyone with handheld fans to cool themselves down.\nI was observing the crowd across the stadium, with many of them fanning themselves.\nWhile I was watching them, I “zoomed-out” my eyeballs, which is a process that I sometimes partake in that I’ll explain in greater detail in another post, but essentially it amounts to switching the context or attention of one’s perception from singular objects to one’s whole field of vision.\nIn doing so, the crowd across the way turned into one cohesive whole, with the flicking of its fans reminding me of the intricate ticking of some gigantic clockwork, or of the pulsating of an organism, or of blades of grass dancing with the blowing of the wind.\nIt was another reminder of oneness for me. The final thought I had was when I was walking to our seats in Stadium 2.\nI made a point to try to be more aware of all of the people walking by and to take note of their behaviors.\nBut the crowd was like a swarm — there were so many faces, noises, sounds, smells — and I got the same feeling of overwhelming sensory stimulation as I had in LA State Historic Park during the peak of my Crisis, when everything sounded like it was booming and echoing in my ears.\nThe feeling only lasted for a couple of seconds, but it made me appreciate how much filtering of input and information that our brains do for us on a daily…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/12/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-10-12","title":"October 12th 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-10-12; BNP Paribas Open; zooming out; oneness of humanity","topics":["journal","tennis","zooming out","the Crisis","oneness"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I had a strange dream last night. Well, in actuality, it was a multitude of dreams, but this particular one disturbed me.\nI only recall a single fragment of it. Someone was cooking a gargantuan purple fish on a gas stove.\nIts jaundiced, bulging eyes protruded from its head and its body was covered in yellowed spikes.\nMost nauseatingly, its mouth was stuffed with tentacles, colored with the same purple hue and littered with the same spikes as were on the rest of the body.\nThe person cooking the fish looked at me and then grabbed ahold of the tentacles and twisted them loose from the fish’s mouth.\nHe said “Here, I know you like this part” (of the fish) and laid the writhing mass on my plate.\nThat was all I remember. But when I woke up, I was extremely repulsed. I have my suspicions regarding the origin of this dream in my subconscious, which is why I decided to record it.\nEarlier this week, I bought some oxtails to make my favorite Korean comfort dish: ggori-gomtang.\nI don’t usually cook meat at home, but I’ve been wanting to make this soup for a while.\nHowever, when I was handling the meat, I was immediately overcome by an involuntary sense of revulsion.\nSomething about the texture of the flesh, the color of blood, the stringy tendons, the definition of the circles on the oxtail cartilage — I almost felt like throwing up. I made the soup, but that experience planted the seeds of guilt in my mind.\nI started to think about how there is no moral justification for the consumption of meat (outside of extenuating personal circumstances, of which I have none), and how I know this and yet still continue to eat it out of my own selfishness.\nI contemplated setting a hard and fast rule on not eating meat at home, but somehow this seemed worse to me than continuing to eat it both at home and out: at least now, I’m forced to be uncomfortable and think about the consequences of my actions.\nIf I allow myself to eat meat in restaurants, I’d be covering up my shame, ignoring the root of the moral issue, and yet I may think myself more moral by virtue of not eating meat at home.\nThings like this should not be left out of sight, out of mind. This experience made me think about a role that dreams often seem to play in one’s (or at least in my) brain: the role of the conscious.\nI was feeling guilty about cooking the oxtails but tried to downplay my guilt, and my dream hung it over me in an unforgettable symbolic form.\nNot to be heretical, but this makes me wonder if the stories…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/04/13/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-04-13","title":"April 13th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-04-13; a dream; guilt about eating meat","topics":["journal","dreams"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Found out from the director of the Research Alliance that I got the position!!! NYC bound, baby!\nI’m extremely excited, but also a little nervous — NYC seems like a huge city (LA is no doubt much larger, but it’s shrunk by my access to a car) and I’m not quite sure how to get my stuff across the country. But I’m certain I’ll figure things out! Finished reading The Trial by Franz Kafka today. A plot recap for myself: Arrest in K.’s room → talk with Frau Grubach → talk with Fräulein Bürstner → appearance in court → encounter with washlady → visit to law offices → two guards and the flogger in the maintenance room → visit from K.’s uncle and visit to the lawyer → conversation with the painter → visit to lawyer for his dismissal, Block the merchant → cathederal → the ending Some initial notes and questions before I go back to revisit the quotes I marked: themes of pride, ego, shame, doubt, guilt, anxiety, paranoia, and transaction in opposition to love, faith, and unconditional acceptance can be read multiple ways, but I think it is more complex, existential, and metaphysical than a condemnation of bureaucracy resonates with my Crisis and in general, the torment of the human psyche paranoia throughout the novel reminds me of the day following the peak of the Crisis and how my own mother was scaring me, how I was analyzing/reading so far into her actions and words to the point that everything she did seemed so foreign and cold and calculating and transactional, when I just desperately wanted/needed comfort and assurance that things would be okay the two guards at the end are like manifestations of cognitive dissonance and indecision the ending also reminds me of “For the Good Times” by Al Green: when presented with the whirling chaos of life and the nonsensicality of it all, what can one do but resign one’s head and hope for a tender embrace? I’m currently listening to “Louange à l’Éternité de Jésus” from Quartet for the End of Time (performed by Yo-Yo Ma on his album Songs from the Arc of Life), and I’m thinking of how this would be a perfect song to accompany the ending of the novel from when I listened to it: slowing down, inevitability, ominous, like the ticking of a clock from wikipedia: Jesus is considered here as the Word. A broad phrase, “infinitely slow”, on the cello, magnifies with love and reverence the eternity of the Word, powerful and gentle, “whose time never runs out”. The melody stretches majestically into a kind of gentle, regal distance. “In…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/09/30/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-09-30","title":"September 30th 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-09-30; life update; finished The Trial; other random thoughts","topics":["journal","life update","the trial","kafka, franz","the Crisis","mother","father","songs from the arc of life","capgras"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I find my thoughts racing, resulting in my inability to sleep. I’m thinking about my Crisis: At the core of the event was the realization that I had built my life on a bed of sand, and it crumbled when the tides of uncertainty came rushing in. I think that I gave myself electroshock therapy, which sounds insane to write out, but it truly felt as if my nervous system was being reprogrammed: I felt shocks down my legs and arms and the nerve endings at the tips of my thumb and index finger turned black. Sensory stimulus afterwards, especially sounds and music, felt as though I was experiencing them for the first time. As a result, a depressive fog that has loomed over me for years and years was lifted. In the months leading up to the climactic event, I had incessant feelings of “strangeness” — something was amiss. I knew certain concepts and themes were important (e.g. Gödel’s incompleteness theorems) and was attracted to them, but I just couldn’t connect the dots. I’d try to write about it, but my cognitive pathways were blocked. The Crisis somehow unclogged these pipes. This all culminated in a moment of awareness and revelation, the seeds of which had been planted throughout my whole life. I experienced feelings of lucidity and control over self, whereas prior to this, I felt as though I was moving through life as a zombie. I’m also thinking about the desire for truth. I sometimes burn with the desire to know the truths of the universe: what was the beginning of it all? What will be the end? Are we hurdling towards some cosmic teleological attractor? Is the desire to know what is fueled by one’s existential dread and a need to know what comes after death? Is there hope for salvation? Is there universal truth? Is there something everlasting and wholly immutable? In Logicomix, they mention that logicians tend towards madness. This makes sense, when one realizes that we’ve built our reality upon sand. Does a rock on which to build our house even exist? The (likely) undecidable nature of this question is enough to drive one insane. I’ve also been thinking about thoughts. I’ve recently realized how much of my cognition relies on visual or spatial constructs: it’s as if there is a visual “overlay” upon most concepts that I hold in my mind. For instance, when I think about months, I envision a calendar, and this calendar has a specific circular orientation (I’ll draw this later). When I think of weeks, I envision a calendar week, which is why my “week” begins on…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2022/03/05/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-03-05","title":"March 5th 2022","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2022-03-05; thoughts on the Crisis; thinking about thoughts; For the Good Times","topics":["journal","the Crisis","cognition","for the good times"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Signed the lease for my NYC apartment today!\nThings are moving so fast, but I’m really grateful that everything is working out so well.\nMy flight is next Wednesday, and I can hardly believe it! Finished reading A Wind in the Door recently.\nI’m trying to revisit books that meant a lot to me as a kid. “No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally - and often far more - worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.”  — C.S. Lewis  And in revisiting this book, I’ve realized how much it probably influenced me and my general worldview.\nFor example, a recurring concept in the book is the relativity of size: the protagonists visit organelles smaller than mitochondria and observe phenomena on the scale of galaxies.\nBut in each of these experiences, there are the same principles and patterns that repeat themselves across time and space.\nThe hierarchy in A Wind in the Door goes: farandolae → mitochondria → human → planet → galaxy → universe.\nIt reminds me of my Crisis revelation of how things are nested into each other like matryoshka (Russian nesting) dolls.\nAlso, I’m sure that this book influenced this dream that I had that can be found in my dream journal: In the beginning, I was at what appeared to be a space station of sorts. Shuttles ebbed and flowed from the terminal, but I didn’t know where they were coming from, or where they were heading. A shuttle stopped in front of me, and I had the inexplicable urge to board it. The shuttle’s interior looked like an airplane’s, and I took a window seat. As soon as I sat down, the shuttle took off. It shrunk down to less than the size of an atom. The next thing I knew, it entered one of my own cells. I looked outside, and I saw that there was a whole universe inside of this cell. Tiny planets and stars littered the vast emptiness, and a double helix threaded the dark space together. … and this reminds me of The Universe in a Single Atom by the Dalai Lama. A Wind in the Door also contains messages about the interconnected nature of things.\nOne of the characters references this proverb: For want of a nail a shoe was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; for want of a horse the rider was lost; for want of a rider the message was lost; for want of a message the battle was lost; for want of a battle the war was lost; for want of the war the kingdom was lost; and all for the want of a horseshoe nail. … and this reminds me the Game of Life, chaos theory, and Tolstoy’s integral metaphor from War…","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2021/10/14/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-10-14","title":"October 14th 2021","subtitle":"Journal entry for 2021-10-14; A Wind in the Door; relativity; interconnectivity","topics":["journal","life update","childhood","the Crisis","interconnectivity"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Thinking more about The Trial today.\nI was listening to “Mystery of Iniquity (Unplugged)” by Ms. Lauryn Hill while on a drive, and it reminded me very strongly of the institution of the court in K.’s trial.\nHere are some of the lyrics: Jesus, if this is not masterful lyricism, then I don’t know what is.\nSome versus that strike me as particularly relevant to The Trial: The more money you pay.. the further away solution And the defense isn’t making any sense // Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence Expert witness (the paid authority) // Made a priority to deceive the majority // Of disinterested peers // Dodging duty for years //Hating the process // waiting to be returning to their careers The truth is obsolete // Only two positions: // Victimizer or Victim // Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system The Revolving Door // Insanity every floor // Skyscraping, paper chasing // What are we working for?

This billboard FORCES you to look at it, since it extends halfway across the freakin’ street.\nHow is this legal? This is one of those LED/digital billboards that have been popping up everywhere as of late. The ad before this one was BRIGHT blue and yellow and was extremely distracting on the road — could you imagine what this would look like at night?\nHow terrifying is it that advertising agencies and urban planners or whoever is responsible for this atrocity would perpetuate consumerism a manner that jeopardizes the safety of drivers?\nThis is horrifying to me.

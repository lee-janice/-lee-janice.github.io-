<span class='newthought'> This website </span> has been simmering in my mind since I first began programming in 2018.
One of the first projects that I wanted to complete after my first programming course was the creation of a personal website, but there were numerous psychological barriers that stood in the way of its birth -- perfectionism, lack of confidence in my programming and writing capabilities, decision paralysis with respect to organization, form, and design -- all of your classic self-sabatoging mentalities.
But one day, riding on the coattails of my existential crisis-fueled euphoria (or as some would say, delusion), I woke up and declared "F@$*, I'm just going to send it!"[^fix]. 
And send it I did, and herein lies the product of that sending. 

[^fix]: A reminder to myself to fix quotation marks that appear before another character.

In the remainder of this page, I'll describe the overarching structure of my website, its intended purpose, the philosophy and inspiration for its content and design, and the technology behind the scenes.

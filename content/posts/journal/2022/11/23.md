Once again—the squirrels are fat; and I am alone.

---

_Where have you been?_ I said to myself—

_where on Earth did you go?_

_You should not look there,_ came the reply.

_I thought that you would've known._

Did you seek yourself in the roars of silence?

_in the deaf'ning and blinding snow?_

Did you search through the veils of joy and pain?

_or in the face of those you know?_

Birth and death hath torn me asunder; now _you_ must endure the throe—

Only then will you find that which you seek; and the answers of far-ago.

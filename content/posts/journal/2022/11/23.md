Once again—the squirrels are fat; and I am alone.

--- 

*Where have you been?* I said to myself—

*where on earth did you go?*

*You cannot look there,* came the reply. 

*I thought that you would know.*

Did you seek me in the roars of silence? 

*in the deaf'ning and blinding snow?*

Did you search for me in all your joys and pain? 

*or in the face of those you know?*

Birth and death hath torn me asunder; now *you* must endure the throe—

Only then will you find that which you need, and the answers of long ago.

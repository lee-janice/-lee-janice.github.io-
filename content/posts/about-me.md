<span class='newthought'>Who are you?</span>
This seemingly innocuous question is one that has plagued me (and no doubt countless others, asking this of themselves) to no foreseeable end. After a long bout of mental anguish and intense contemplation regarding myself, my memories, my relationships, and my place in the grand scheme of the universe, I've come to the conclusion that the concept of a unified, cohesive self may very well be illusory, and that accepting myself as *everchanging and interconnected potential* rather than trying to cram the totality of who I am into a concrete, fixed reality does wonders for my wellbeing.

That being said, the concept of myself still exists, floating around in the ambient space of consciousness.
I created this document to capture some of those concepts. 
I hope that it will lend itself to a picture in your mind of who I am or who I was at some point in time. 
However, I do have trouble describing myself (see above), so if you really want to get to know me, contact me! ☺

## Where have I been and what have I done?

## Where am I and what am I doing? 
--- 

This is a good question, and a hard one to respond to.
I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time.
In terms of major life events, I'm in Los Angeles, recovering from a major existential crisis that occurred shortly after my undergraduate graduation, and am now applying to jobs!
I'm currently interviewing for a technical research analyst position at the NYU-hosted Research Alliance for NYC Schools.
Fingers crossed!


## What do I like? 
--- 

In short, I like everything.
What's not to like about the miracles of the universe, whether conventionally good or bad?
But while I do like everything, I get attached to particular things. 
Here are some of those things.

### Current interests

In light of my aforementioned existential crisis, I've awakened a huge appetite for gathering information about the nature of us, consciousness, reality, love, the universe, and other abstract and intangible concepts.
One of the realizations to come out of this crisis is the incredible interconnectedness of all things - everything is everything else - and as such I'd like to get exposure to all sorts of people, experiences, and ideas. 

In general, I'm currently interested in metaphysics, phenomenology, Buddhism, metacognition and learning, meta*, the brain, the future of artificial intelligence, aesthetics, strange loops, the philosophy of education, patterns and exceptions, imagination and creativity, metaphors and isomorphisms, communication, unconditional love, praxis, radical change.

[^liszt]: From the [Hollywood Bowl](https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/musicdb/pieces/458/les-jeux-deau-a-la-villa-deste): At the midpoint of Franz Liszt’s *Les jeux d’eaux à la Villa d’Este* (The Fountains of the Villa d’Este), as the music modulates into a radiant D major, the composer places in the score the following inscription from the Gospel According to John: *Sed aqua quam ego dabo ei, fiet in eo fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam* (But the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up into eternal life)... While *Les jeux d’eaux à la Villa d’Este* is the progenitor of all pianistic water-music to come (Ravel and Debussy lay decades ahead), its intent goes beyond the musical depiction of the rilling and leaping of waters in fountains. It offers water as the symbolic focus of profound contemplation.

<span class='newthought'>Who are you?</span>
This seemingly innocuous question is one that has plagued me (and no doubt countless others, asking this of themselves) to no foreseeable end. After a long bout of mental anguish and intense contemplation regarding myself, my memories, my relationships, and my place in the grand scheme of the universe, I've come to the conclusion that the concept of a unified, cohesive self may very well be illusory, and that accepting myself as *everchanging and interconnected potential* rather than trying to cram the totality of who I am[^self] into a concrete, fixed reality does wonders for my wellbeing.

[^self]: Even this website - its design, its content, my writing style - makes me slightly uncomfortable because of the image of me that it might paint in your mind. The goofier, meme-ier me is cringing at myself for taking things and myself so seriously; the contemplative, solemn me is resisting this ridicule. *What then shall we choose? Weight or lightness? - Milan Kundera, The Unbearable Lightness of Being*

That being said, the concept of myself still exists, floating around in the ambient space of consciousness.
I created this document to capture some of those concepts. 
I hope that it will lend itself to a picture in your mind of who I am or who I was at some point in time. 
However, I do have trouble describing myself (see above), so if you really want to get to know me, [contact me](#contact)! ☺

## Where have I been and what have I done?

## Where am I and what am I doing? 
--- 

This is a good question, and a hard one to respond to.
I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time.
In terms of major life events, I'm currently residing in Los Angeles, recovering from a major existential crisis that occurred shortly after my undergraduate graduation, and am now applying to jobs!
I'm interviewing for a technical research analyst position at the NYU-hosted Research Alliance for NYC Schools.
Fingers crossed!



## What do I like? 
--- 
<div class='epigraph'>

> Dogen-zenji said, "Although everything has Buddha nature, we love flowers, and we do not care for weeds." This is true of human nature. But that we are attached  to  some beauty is itself Buddha's  activity.  That we do not care for weeds is also Buddha's activity. We should know that.  If you know that, it is all right to attach to something.  If it is Buddha's attachment, that is non-attachment.  So in love  there should be hate, or non-attachment.  And in hate there should be love, or acceptance.  Love and hate are one thing. <footer> -- Shunryu Suzuki; *Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind* </footer>

In short, I like everything.
What's not to love about the miracles of the universe, whether conventionally good or bad?
But while I do like everything, I am particularly fond of certain things. 
Here are some of those things.

### Current interests

In light of my aforementioned existential crisis, I've awakened a huge appetite within myself for gathering information about the nature of us, consciousness, reality, love, the universe, and other abstract and intangible concepts.
One of the realizations to come out of this crisis is the incredible interconnectedness of all things - I now believe that everything is everything else - and as such I'd like to get exposure to all sorts of people, experiences, and ideas. 

In general, I'm currently interested in metaphysics, phenomenology, Buddhism, metacognition and learning, meta*[^kleene], hyper*, the brain, the future of artificial intelligence, aesthetics, strange loops, the philosophy of education, patterns and exceptions, imagination and creativity, metaphors and isomorphisms, communication, unconditional love, praxis, radical change.

[^kleene]: A [Kleene star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star), indicating that I'm interested in anything with meta as a prefix (or anything meta-related, really), such as metaphysics, metacognition, metamathematics, metaphor...

[^liszt]: From the [Hollywood Bowl](https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/musicdb/pieces/458/les-jeux-deau-a-la-villa-deste): At the midpoint of Franz Liszt’s *Les jeux d’eaux à la Villa d’Este* (The Fountains of the Villa d’Este), as the music modulates into a radiant D major, the composer places in the score the following inscription from the Gospel According to John: *Sed aqua quam ego dabo ei, fiet in eo fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam* (But the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up into eternal life)...
    While *Les jeux d’eaux à la Villa d’Este* is the progenitor of all pianistic water-music to come (Ravel and Debussy lay decades ahead), its intent goes beyond the musical depiction of the rilling and leaping of waters in fountains. It offers water as the symbolic focus of profound contemplation.

## What am I like? 
--- 

This is another incredibly difficult question for me to answer.
Asking different people at different points in time will invariably produce different results.
One person once upon a time called me a "ball of energy," a description which I particularly enjoy at this moment.
I do think that there is something about my being (maybe about every being?) that resists collapse into a singular or definite form.
And I tend to have a lot of energy, although at other times you can find me sleeping upwards of 15 hours a day!

Although I am hesitant to prescribe much credence to psychological and personality tests, I do think that they can give some rounded notion of what tendencies a person may have. Here are the percentile results from my [IPIP Big Five personality test](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/), taken on 2021-09-19: 

- Factor I, Extroversion: 22
- Factor II, Emotional stability: 78
- Factor III, Agreeableness: 95
- Factor IV, Conscientiousness: 41
- Factor V, Intellect/Imagination[^open]: 91

[^open]: According to the site, this factor is also called Openness to experience, which I would say is a more accurate term.

Here are some words that I may describe myself with: optimistic; bold-at-times; incredibly-shy-at-others; goofy; awkward; a little cringy; a hopeful romantic; unconditionally accepting; chromatic; oscillating; rippling; ideating; bubbling; paradoxical; dialectical, nonsensical.

> We're lowly employees who can barely make our way through such documents, and whose only role in your affair is to stand guard over you ten hours a day and get paid for it. That's all we are, but we're smart enough to realize that before ordering such an arrest the higher authorities who employ us inform themselves in great detail about the person they're arresting and the grounds for the arrest. There's been no mistake.  <footer> Dialogue from guard to K.; *chapter 1 (Arrest), page 8*; importance: 4 </footer>


> The inspector cries out as if he has to wake me up, practically shouting; unfortunately I'll have to shout too, to show you how it was; all he shouts is his name, by the way.  <footer> Dialogue from K. to Fräulein Bürstner; *chapter 2 (Conversation with Frau Grubach, then Fräulein Bürstner), page 31* importance: 3 </footer>

> ... before falling asleep he reflected briefly on his conduct: he was pleased with it, but was surprised that he didn't feel even more pleased; he was seriously concerned on Fräulein Bürstner's behalf because of the captain. <footer> *chapter 2 (Conversation with Frau Grubach, then Fräulein Bürstner), page 33*; importance: 3 </footer> 

> He regretted his plan, which had at first seemed so practical. As he was approaching the fifth floor he decided to give up the search, took his leave from a friendly young worker who wanted to lead him further upward, and started back down. But then, annoyed once more by the futility of the whole enterprise, he returned and knocked at the first door on the fifth floor. <footer> *chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), page 41*; importance: 4 </footer> 

> K. let him lead the way; it turned out that there was indeed a narrow path free through the swirling crowd, one that possibly divided two parties; this possibility was further supported by the fact that K. saw scarcely a face turned toward him in the closest rows on his left and right, but merely the backs of people addressing their words and gestures solely to those in their own party. <footer> *chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), page 42*; importance: 4 </footer> 

> "Your question, Your Honor, about my being a house painter -- and you weren't really asking at all, you were telling me outright -- is characteristic of the way these entire proceedings against me are being conducted. You may object that these aren't proceedings at all, and you're certainly right there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such... what has happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I don't take it very seriously, but it is typical of the proceedings being brought against many people. I speak for them, not myself... The examining magistrate here beside me has just given one of you a secret signal. So there are those among you who are being directed from up here... there can be no doubt that behind all the pronouncements of this court, and in my case, behind the arrest and today's inquiry, there exists an extensive organization. An organization that not only engages corrupt guards, inane inspectors, and examining magistrates who are at best mediocre, but that supports as well a system of judges of all ranks, including the highest, with their inevitable innumerable entourage of assistants, scribes, gendarmes, and other aides, perhaps even hangmen, I won't shy away from the word... So!... I see you're all officials, you're the corrupt band I was speaking about; you've crowded in here to listen and snoop, you've formed apparent parties and had one side applaud to test me, you wanted to learn how to lead innocent men astray." <footer> K. addressing the assembly; *chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), pages 45-52*; importance: 1 </footer> 

> The two parties, which had appeared to hold such contrasting opinions before, mingled with one another, some people pointing their fingers at K., others at the examining magistrate. The foglike haze in the room was extremely annoying, even preventing any closer observation of those standing further away... K. was interrupted by a shriek from the other end of the hall; he shaded his eyes so that he could see, for the dull daylight had turned the haze into a blinding white glare. <footer> *chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), pages 49 and 51*; importance: 2 </footer> 

> "I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact," said the examining magistrate, "that you have today deprived yourself -- although you can't yet have realized it -- the advantage that an interrogation offers to the arrested man in each case." <footer> Dialogue from examining magistrate to K.; *chapter 3 (Initial Inquiry), page 52*; importance: 1 </footer>

This love knew not the summer woods<br>
&nbsp;before it turned a falt’ring page<br>
&nbsp;for whispers of a blinding rage<br>
had drowned its sights in debts of _should_<br>

At breath this beast does strike and rake<br>
&nbsp;with claws of adamantine time<br>
&nbsp;too late, I find the claw is _mine_<br>
and I alone had strangled fate<br>

But even with a heart not prest<br>
&nbsp;I now behold, by light of troth,<br>  
&nbsp;the majesties of seas thus frothed<br>
and lay hope upon day’s gilded crest<br>

It still rings true, despite the fall<br>
&nbsp;no mind to mourn, no matter cost:<br>
&nbsp;’tis better to have loved and lost<br>
than never to have loved at all.<br>

      We're lowly employees who can barely make our way through such documents, 
      and whose only role in your affair is to stand guard over you ten hours a day 
      and get paid for it. That's all we are, but we're smart enough to realize that 
      before ordering such an arrest the higher authorities who employ us inform 
      themselves in great detail about the person they're arresting and the grounds 
      for the arrest. There's been no mistake.

      The inspector cries out as if he has to wake me up, practically shouting; 
      unfortunately I'll have to shout too, to show you how it was; all he shouts 
      is his name, by the way.

      with it, but was surprised that he didn't feel even more pleased; he was seriously 
      concerned on Fräulein Bürstner's behalf because of the captain."

      He regretted his plan, which had at first seemed so practical. As he was approaching 
      the fifth floor he decided to give up the search, took his leave from a friendly 
      young worker who wanted to lead him further upward, and started back down. But then, 
      annoyed once more by the futility of the whole enterprise, he returned and knocked at 
      the first door on the fifth floor.

      K. let him lead the way; it turned out that there was indeed a narrow path free through 
      the swirling crowd, one that possibly divided two parties; this possibility was further 
      supported by the fact that K. saw scarcely a face turned toward him in the closest rows 
      on his left and right, but merely the backs of people addressing their words and gestures 
      solely to those in their own party.

      Your question, Your Honor, about my being a house painter -- and you weren't really asking 
      at all, you were telling me outright -- is characteristic of the way these entire proceedings 
      against me are being conducted. You may object that these aren't proceedings at all, and you're 
      certainly right there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such... what has 
      happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I 
      don't take it very seriously, but it is typical of the proceedings being brought against 
      many people. I speak for them, not myself... The examining magistrate here beside me has 
      just given one of you a secret signal. So there are those among you who are being directed 
      from up here... there can be no doubt that behind all the pronouncements of this court, and 
      in my case, behind the arrest and today's inquiry, there exists an extensive organization. 
      An organization that not only engages corrupt guards, inane inspectors, and examining magistrates 
      who are at best mediocre, but that supports as well a system of judges of all ranks, including 
      the highest, with their inevitable innumerable entourage of assistants, scribes, gendarmes, and 
      other aides, perhaps even hangmen, I won't shy away from the word... So!... I see you're all 
      officials, you're the corrupt band I was speaking about; you've crowded in here to listen and 
      snoop, you've formed apparent parties and had one side applaud to test me, you wanted to learn 
      how to lead innocent men astray.

      The two parties, which had appeared to hold such contrasting opinions before, mingled with one 
      another, some people pointing their fingers at K., others at the examining magistrate. The 
      foglike haze in the room was extremely annoying, even preventing any closer observation of 
      those standing further away... K. was interrupted by a shriek from the other end of the hall; 
      he shaded his eyes so that he could see, for the dull daylight had turned the haze into a 
      blinding white glare.

      "I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact," said the examining magistrate,

      the advantage that an interrogation offers to the arrested man in each case."

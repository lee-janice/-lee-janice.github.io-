You may object that these aren&#x27;t proceedings at all, and you&#x27;re  certainly right there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such... what has  happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I  don&#x27;t take it very seriously, but it is typical of the proceedings being brought against  many people. I speak for them, not myself... The examining magistrate here beside me has  just given one of you a secret signal. So there are those among you who are being directed  from up here... there can be no doubt that behind all the pronouncements of this court, and  in my case, behind the arrest and today&#x27;s inquiry, there exists an extensive organization.  An organization that not only engages corrupt guards, inane inspectors, and examining magistrates  who are at best mediocre, but that supports as well a system of judges of all ranks, including  the highest, with their inevitable innumerable entourage of assistants, scribes, gendarmes, and  other aides, perhaps even hangmen, I won&#x27;t shy away from the word... So!... I see you&#x27;re all  officials, you&#x27;re the corrupt band I was speaking about; you&#x27;ve crowded in here to listen and  snoop, you&#x27;ve formed apparent parties and had one side applaud to test me, you wanted to learn  how to lead innocent men astray.

K. was interrupted by a shriek from the other end of the hall;  he shaded his eyes so that he could see, for the dull daylight had turned the haze into a  blinding white glare.

But K. didn&#x27;t want to  go to the infirmary; that was precisely what he wanted to avoid, being led farther on, for the farther he went,  the worse things would get... in reality it would have done him a good deal to sit down; he felt seasick.  He thought he was on a ship, rolling in heavy seas. It seemed to him that the waters were pounding against  the wooden walls, there was a roar from the depths of the hallway like the sound of breaking waves, the hallway  seemed to pitch and roll, lifting and lowering the waiting clients on both sides... He realized at last that  they were speaking to him, but he couldn&#x27;t understand them; he heard only the noise that filled everything,  through which a steady, high-pitched sound like a siren seemed to emerge... he heard beside him: &quot;First he  wants to leave, then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the exit and he doesn&#x27;t move.&quot;

Even if it were possible  to improve specific details-which, however, is merely an absurd superstition-one would have  at best achieved something for future cases, while in the process damaging oneself immeasurably  by having attracted the attention of an always vengeful bureaucracy. Just don&#x27;t attract attention!  Keep calm, no matter how much it seems counter to good sense. Try to realize that this vast  judicial organism remains, so to speak, inn a state of eternal equilibrium, and that if you  change something on your own where you are, you can cut the ground out from your own feet and  fall, while the vast organism easily compensates for the minor disturbance at some other  spot-after all, everything is interconnected-and remains unchanged, if not, which is likely,  even more resolute, more vigilant, more severe, more malicious.

These tell of actual acquittals, of course, even in a majority of cases; you can believe  them, but they can&#x27;t be proved true.

He was leaning on his sword, which he had thrust into the bare  earth-only a few blades of grass sprang up here and there-before him. He seemed to be gazing  attentively at a scene taking place directly in front of him... he discovered it was a conventional  depiction of the entombment of Christ, and moreover a fairly recent one.

At the moment he was still free; he could walk on and  leave through one of the three small dark wooden doors not far from him. That would mean he  hadn&#x27;t understood or that he had indeed understood but couldn&#x27;t be bothered to respond.

A man from  the country comes to this doorkeeper and requests admittance to the Law. But the doorkeeper  says that he can&#x27;t grant him admittance now. The man thinks it over and then asks if  he&#x27;ll be allowed to enter later. &#x27;It&#x27;s possible,&#x27; says the doorkeeper, &#x27;but not now.&#x27;  Since the gate to the Law stands open as always, and the doorkeeper steps aside,  the man bends down to look through the gate into the interior. WWhen the doorkeeper  sees this he laughs and says, &#x27;If you&#x27;re so drawn to it, go ahead and try to enter,  even though I&#x27;ve forbidden it. But bear this in mind: I&#x27;m powerful. And I&#x27;m only the  lowest doorkeeper. From hall to hall, however, stand doorkeepers each more powerful than  the one before. The mere sight of the third is more than even I can bear.&#x27;... he decides  he would prefer to wait until he receives permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a  stool and lets him sit down at the side of the door. He sits there for days and years...  Finally his eyes grow dim and he no longer knows whether it&#x27;s really getting darker around  him or if his eyes are merely deceiving him. And yet in the darkness he now sees a radiance  that streams forth inextinguishably from the door of the Law. He doesn&#x27;t have much longer  to live now. Before he dies, everything he has experienced over the years coalesces in his  mind into a single question he has never asked the doorkeeper... &#x27;Everyone strives to reach  the Law,&#x27; says the man, &#x27;how does it happen, then, that in all these years no one but me  has requested admittance. The doorkeeper sees that the man is nearing his end, and in order  to reach his failing hearing, he roars at him: &#x27;No one else could gain admittance here,  because this entrance was meant solely for you. I&#x27;m going to go and shut it now.&#x27;&quot;

Once more the nauseating courtesies began, one of  them passed the knife across K. to the other, who passed it back over K. K. knew  clearly now that it was his duty to seize the knife as it floated from hand to hand  above him and plunge it into himself. But he didn&#x27;t do so; instead he twisted his  still-free neck and looked about him... His gaze fell upon the top story of the  building adjoining the quarry. Like a light flicking on, the casements of a window  flew open, a human figure, faint and insubstantial at that distance and height,  leaned far out abruptly, and stretched both arms out even further. Who was it?  A friend? A good person? Someone who cared? Someone who wanted to help? Was it just  one person? Was it everyone? Was there still help? Were there objections that had  been forgotten? Of course there were. Logic is no doubt unshakable, but it can&#x27;t  withstand a person who wants to live. Where waws the judge he&#x27;d never seen? Where was  the high court he&#x27;d never reached? He raised hiss hands and spread out all his fingers.
But the hands of one man were right at K.&#x27;s throat, while the other thrust the knife  into his heart and turned it there twice. With failing sight K. saw how the men  drew near his face, leaning cheek-to-cheek to observe the verdict. &quot;Like a dog!&quot;  he said; it seemed as though the shame was to outlive him.

In the beginning, I was at what appeared to be a space station of sorts. Shuttles ebbed and flowed from the terminal, but I didn’t know where they were coming from, or where they were heading. A shuttle stopped in front of me, and I had the inexplicable urge to board it. The shuttle’s interior looked like an airplane’s, and I took a window seat. As soon as I sat down, the shuttle took off. It shrunk down to less than the size of an atom. The next thing I knew, it entered one of my own cells. I looked outside, and I saw that there was a whole universe inside of this cell. Tiny planets and stars littered the vast emptiness, and a double helix threaded the dark space together.</p></section>

There were lots of subway trains and when I got off of the train I sat in some water and waited for Dad
Dad sacrificed himself for me (don’t know how) and he got put into the hospital
Dystopian hospital with cult of doctors and they tried to keep us from the room but one female doctor gave us hints and told us where to go and the room he was in was super creepy and guarded by 2 girls with pink hair but we got past them by holding the hands of 2 purple haired mannequins which put them in a trance
Then he was laying in a bed with a weird creepy mask over his face and 2 bugs were crawling over his bed and I took the mask off and cried a lot and then woke up</p></section>

I had like 5 different dreams
One it was like a weird outside mall looking thing except it had colleges in them and you would go and take interviews in them
And I went to princetons and UCLAs and I made like a PowerPoint thing but they hated me
And I saw them afterwards and someone added weird messages at the end of my power points
Like duck duck egg
And some offensive things
I don’t remember LOL</p><p>And then the next dream
I went to your house
But it wasn’t your house
But like you lived there
Omg no it was a bad dream
You weren’t there but I went in
And then i saw my sister there
And I got really mad and asked her how she got in
And she wouldn’t tell me and I got sooooo mad
And then somehow Ashley hong was there or something
And she knew how but she wouldn’t tell me
And I got super mad at her too
But then she showed me that she went over the door
BC the top of the door like flipped open
And then it was chill
But then your door started decaying
And I freaked out
And I tried to fix it by removing the door
But nothing worked and it got worse
And I tried to call someone to come fix it
But I think you came back and said it was ok and fixed it
I don’t really remember</p><p>But then the next dream was like at the same house but it wasn’t yours this time
My mom bought tickets to go to Hawaii
But the plane was leaving really soon
And I didn’t have anything packed and I wasn’t home
So we left to Hawaii with like no luggage
And I was really mad
Then we went to the hotel
And I could hear ppl having sex in the next room
Which was weird
Then I don’t remember how it ended</p><p>Okay okay but the next dream
I was like going to the backyard thing
And then I saw these huge gerbils
Or hamsters
And like they were standing on two legs
And talking
And I was like wtf
And I followed them
And like there were peacocks there
And I don’t really remember this very well
But there was like a magical garden type thing
And like a woman with red hair
And she was like the last of her kind or something or idk
There were just like 2 sides that were fighting
Okay I don’t remember this one very well
LOL</p><p>Then the last one
We were in tootell S classroom
And we got these sticks or something with like questions or something idk
And I got slaves
And then I was like talking about how like America depended on slave labor and stuff
And then you and Raam were like omg you don’t know what you’re talking about
nd then I was like ☹
And then there was a huge spider on the ceiling
Like the hugest spider ever
And someone tried to kill it
And then I woke up</p></section>

LOL
and then we walked along the beach
and that was nice
but then suddenly you had to go cuz you were gonna get in trouble
so i went in the waves
then i woke up
but then i had another dream
cuz i fell back to sleep
so it was my birthday
and what i was gonna do is take spaceshuttle things into space
so we were at school
and i bicycled up these space shuttle things
and caroline, minji, david and elizabeth got into mine
and elizabeth had pie

That a lot of people died
Other people too but I forgot who
It was so scary
Minji died
It was some sort of breathing disease
And they died in this room
On the floor
It was empty
And everyone crowded around them
And they died
And Minji had this dying wish
Forgot what it was though
Then we went outside
And it was raining
And I got picked up by this weird Korean lady</p></section></div><ul class="sc-jSMfEi guuuKw"><li><a rel="prev" href="/notes/books/novels/kafka-franz-the-trial/">← <!-- -->Kafka, Franz; The Trial</a></li><li><a rel="next" href="/notes/personal/content-consumption-queue/">Content consumption queue<!-- --> →</a></li></ul></div></article></main><footer class="sc-hKMtZM hYZRff footer">© <!-- -->2022<!-- -->,<!-- --> <a href="https://lee-janice.github.io">a cozy space</a>.

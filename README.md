Hi! This is the repository for my personal website, which you can visit [here](https://lee-janice.github.io). 

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and is built using Gatsby. The design builds off of the work of [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte) in the form of [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
Feel free to leave any comments or tell me ways that I could improve my site in the Issues tab!

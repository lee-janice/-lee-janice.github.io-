      We asked him how
      it was to live under Communism, and he said that it was terrible at first, because everybody had to work
      so hard, and because there wasn't much shelter or food or clothing. But things were much better now. He
      had a pleasant little apartment, and his daughter was getting an excellent education. His mother was
      incinerated in the Dresden fire-storm. So it goes.

      'I think the climax of the book will be the execution of poor old Edgar Derby,' I said. 'The irony is so
      great. A whole city gets burned down, and thousands and thousands of people are killed. And then this
      one American foot soldier is arrested in the ruins for taking a teapot. And he's given a regular trial, and
      then he's shot by a firing squad.'

      'Um,' said O'Hare.

      'Don't you think that's really where the climax should come?' 'I don't know anything about it,' he said.

      'That's your trade, not mine.'

      I think about my education sometimes. I went to the University of Chicago for a while after the Second
      World War. I was a student in the Department of Anthropology. At that time, they were teaching that
      there was absolutely no difference between anybody. They may be teaching that still.
      Another thing they taught was that nobody was ridiculous or bad or disgusting. Shortly before my
      father died, he said to me, 'You know-you never wrote a story with a villain in it.'
      I told him that was one of the things I learned in college after the war.

      The time would not pass. Somebody was playing with the clocks, and not only with the electric
      clocks, but the wind-up kind, too. The second hand on my watch would twitch once, and a year would
      pass, and then it would twitch again.
  
      There was nothing I could do about it. As an Earthling., I had to believe whatever clocks said-and
      calendars.

      No art is possible without a dance with death, he wrote.

      The truth is death, he wrote. I've fought nicely against it as long as I could... danced with it,
      festooned it, waltzed it around... decorated it with streamers, titillated it...

      Time obsessed him. Miss Ostrovsky reminded me of the amazing scene in Death on the Installment
      Plan where Céline wants to stop the bustling of a street crowd. He screams on paper, Make them stop
      ... don't let them move anymore at all ... There, make them freeze ... once and for all! ... So that
      they won't disappear anymore!

      I looked through the Gideon Bible in my motel room for tales of great destruction. The sun was risen
      upon the Earth when Lot entered into Zo-ar, I read. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon
      Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven; and He overthrew those cities, and all
      the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

      So it goes.

      Those were vile people in both those cities, as is well known. The world was better off without them.

      And Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had
      been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human.

      She was turned to a pillar of salt. So it goes.

      People aren't supposed to look back. I'm certainly not going to do it anymore.

      I've finished my war book now. The next one I write is going to be fun.

      This one is a failure, and had to be, since it was written by a pillar of salt. It begins like this:

      Listen:

      Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.

      It ends like this:
      
      Poo-tee-weet?

      Billy was working on his second letter when the first letter was published. The second letter started out
      like this:

      'The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to
      die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments,
      past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the
      different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can
      see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an
      illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once
      a moment is gone it is gone forever.

      'When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that
      particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself
      hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people,
      which is "so it goes."'

      And so on.

      Billy Pilgrim had stopped in the forest. He was leaning against a tree with his eyes closed. His head
      was tilted back and his nostrils were flaring. He was like a poet in the Parthenon.

      This was when Billy first came unstuck in time. His attention began to swing grandly through the full arc
      of his life, passing into death, which was violet light. There wasn't anybody else there, or any thing. There
      was just violet light and a hum.

      And then Billy swung into life again, going backwards until he was in pre-birth, which was red light and
      bubbling sounds. And then he swung into life again and stopped. He was a little boy taking a shower with
      his hairy father at the Ilium Y.M.C.A. He smelled chlorine from the swimming pool next door, heard the
      springboard boom.

      Little Billy was terrified, because his father had said Billy was going to learn to swim by the method of
      sink-or-swim. Ms father was going to throw Billy into the deep end, and Billy was going to damn well
      swim.

      It was like an execution. Billy was numb as his father carried him from the shower room to the pool.
      His eyes were closed. When he opened his eyes, he was on the bottom of the pool, and there was
      beautiful music everywhere. He lost consciousness, but the music went on. He dimly sensed that
      somebody was rescuing him. Billy resented that.

      From there he traveled in time to 1965. He was forty-one years old, and he was visiting his decrepit
      mother at Pine Knoll, an old people's home he had put her in only a month before. She had caught
      pneumonia, and wasn't expected to live. She did live, though, for years after that.

      Her voice was nearly gone, so, in order to hear her, Billy had to put his ear right next to her papery
      lips. She evidently had something very important to say.

      'How ...?' she began, and she stopped. She was too tired. She hoped that she wouldn't have to say
      the rest of the sentence, and that Billy would finish it for her

      But Billy had no idea what was on her mind. 'How what, Mother?' he prompted.

      She swallowed hard, shed some tears. Then she gathered energy from all over her ruined body, even
      from her toes and fingertips. At last she bad accumulated enough to whisper this complete sentence:

      'How did I get so old ?'

      Billy Pilgrim, there in the creekbed, thought he, Billy Pilgrim, was turning to steam painlessly. If
      everybody would leave him alone for just a little while, he thought, he wouldn't cause anybody any more
      trouble. He would turn to steam and float up among the treetops.

      The Germans and the dog were engaged in a military operation which had an amusingly self-explanatory
      name, a human enterprise which is seldom described in detail, whose name alone, when reported as
      news or history, gives many war enthusiasts a sort of post-coital satisfaction. It is, in the imagination of
      combat's fans, the divinely listless loveplay that follows the orgasm of victory. It is called 'mopping up.'

      Those boots were almost all he owned in this world. They were his home. An anecdote: One time a
      recruit was watching him bone and wax those golden boots, and he held one up to the recruit and said, 'If
      you look in there deeply enough, you'll see Adam and Eve.'

      Billy Pilgrim had not heard this anecdote. But, lying on the black ice there, Billy stared into the patina
      of the corporal's boots, saw Adam and Eve in the golden depths. They were naked. They were so
      innocent, so vulnerable, so eager to behave decently. Billy Pilgrim loved them.

      Billy had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping going, even
      though he was unenthusiastic about living. A lot of patients who saw the prayer on Billy's wall told him
      that it helped them to keep going, too. It went like this

      GOD GRANT ME

      THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT

      THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE

      COURAGE

      TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN,

      AND WISDOM ALWAYS

      TO TELL THE

      DIFFERENCE.

      Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past, the present and the future.

      Even though Billy's train wasn't moving, its boxcars were kept locked tight. Nobody was to get off
      until the final destination. To the guards who walked up and down outside, each car became a single
      organism which ate and drank and excreted through its ventilators. It talked or sometimes yelled through
      its ventilators, too. In went water and loaves of blackbread and sausage and cheese, and out came shit
      and piss and language.

      Human beings in there were excreting into steel helmets, which were passed to the people at the
      ventilators, who dumped them. Billy was a dumper. The human beings also passed canteens, which
      guards would fill with water. When food came in, the human beings were quiet and trusting and beautiful.
      They shared.

      'Welcome aboard, Mr. Pilgrim,' said the loudspeaker. 'Any questions?'

      Billy licked his lips, thought a while, inquired at last: 'Why me?'

      That is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim. Why you? Why us for that matter? Why
      anything ? Because this moment simply is. Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?'

      'Yes.' Billy in fact, had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three
      ladybugs embedded in it.

      'Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.

      this event is structured as it is, telling how other events may be achieved or avoided. I am a
      Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you might see a stretch of Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does
      not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is. Take it moment by moment,
      and you will find that we are all, as I've said before, bugs in amber.'

      'You sound to me as though you don't believe in free will,' said Billy Pilgrim.

      'If I hadn't spent so much time studying Earthlings,' said the Tralfamadorian, 'I wouldn't have any idea
      what was meant by "free will." I've visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe, and I have studied
      reports on one hundred more. Only on Earth is there any talk of free will.'

      Billy Pilgrim says that the Universe does not look like a lot of bright little dots to the creatures from
      Tralfamadore. The creatures can see where each star has been and where it is going, so that the heavens
      are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti. And Tralfamadorians don't see human beings as two-legged
      creatures, either. They see them as great millipedes with babies' legs at one end and old people's legs at
      the other, says Billy Pilgrim.

      'There are no telegrams on Tralfamadore. But you're right: each clump of-symbols is a brief, urgent
      message describing a situation, a scene. We Tralfamadorians read them all at once, not one after the
      other. There isn't any particular relationship between all the messages, except that the author has chosen
      them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising
      and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What
      we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.'

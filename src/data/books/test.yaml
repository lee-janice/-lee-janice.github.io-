    We're lowly employees who can barely make our way through such documents, 
    and whose only role in your affair is to stand guard over you ten hours a day 
    and get paid for it. That's all we are, but we're smart enough to realize that 
    before ordering such an arrest the higher authorities who employ us inform 
    themselves in great detail about the person they're arresting and the grounds 
    for the arrest. There's been no mistake.

    He regretted his plan, which had at first seemed so practical. As he was approaching 
    the fifth floor he decided to give up the search, took his leave from a friendly 
    young worker who wanted to lead him further upward, and started back down. But then, 
    annoyed once more by the futility of the whole enterprise, he returned and knocked at 
    the first door on the fifth floor.

    K. let him lead the way; it turned out that there was indeed a narrow path free through 
    the swirling crowd, one that possibly divided two parties; this possibility was further 
    supported by the fact that K. saw scarcely a face turned toward him in the closest rows 
    on his left and right, but merely the backs of people addressing their words and gestures 
    solely to those in their own party.

    Your question, Your Honor, about my being a house painter -- and you weren't really asking 
    at all, you were telling me outright -- is characteristic of the way these entire proceedings 
    against me are being conducted. You may object that these aren't proceedings at all, and you're 
    certainly right there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such... what has 
    happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I 
    don't take it very seriously, but it is typical of the proceedings being brought against 
    many people. I speak for them, not myself... The examining magistrate here beside me has 
    just given one of you a secret signal. So there are those among you who are being directed 
    from up here... there can be no doubt that behind all the pronouncements of this court, and 
    in my case, behind the arrest and today's inquiry, there exists an extensive organization. 
    An organization that not only engages corrupt guards, inane inspectors, and examining magistrates 
    who are at best mediocre, but that supports as well a system of judges of all ranks, including 
    the highest, with their inevitable innumerable entourage of assistants, scribes, gendarmes, and 
    other aides, perhaps even hangmen, I won't shy away from the word... So!... I see you're all 
    officials, you're the corrupt band I was speaking about; you've crowded in here to listen and 
    snoop, you've formed apparent parties and had one side applaud to test me, you wanted to learn 
    how to lead innocent men astray.

    The two parties, which had appeared to hold such contrasting opinions before, mingled with one 
    another, some people pointing their fingers at K., others at the examining magistrate. The 
    foglike haze in the room was extremely annoying, even preventing any closer observation of 
    those standing further away... K. was interrupted by a shriek from the other end of the hall; 
    he shaded his eyes so that he could see, for the dull daylight had turned the haze into a 
    blinding white glare.

    "I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact," said the examining magistrate,

    the advantage that an interrogation offers to the arrested man in each case."

    "You'd probably like to improve a few things around here?" the woman asked slowly and tentatively, 
    as if she were saying something dangerous for her as well as for K. "It's so disgusting here... 
    Do you think you'll be able to improve things?" K. smiled and turned his hand slightly in her soft hands. 
    "Actually," he said, "it's not my job to improve things here, as you put it, and if you said that to 
    someone like the examining magistrate you'd be laughed at or punished. I certainly wouldn't have 
    become involved in these matters of my own free will, and I would never have lost any sleep over 
    the shortcomings of this judicial system. But because I was supposedly placed under arrest -- I've been 
    arrested, you see -- I've been forced to take action in my own behalf. But if I can be of any help to you 
    in the process, I'll of course be happy to do so. Not simply out of compassion, but because you can help 
    me in turn."

    “You see,” said the court usher, “they’re always taking her away from me. Today is Sunday, and 
    I have no official duties, but just to get me out of the way, they send me off with a message 
    that’s meaningless anyway. And in fact I’m not sent far, so that the hope remains that if I 
    really hurry, I might get back in time. I run as fast as I can to the office they’ve sent me to, 
    shout my message so breathlessly through the half-open door that they probably don’t understand it, 
    and race back again, but the student has moved even faster than I have, and of course he doesn’t 
    have as far to go, he has only to run down the attic stairs. If I weren’t so dependent on them, 
    I would have long since crushed the student against this wall."

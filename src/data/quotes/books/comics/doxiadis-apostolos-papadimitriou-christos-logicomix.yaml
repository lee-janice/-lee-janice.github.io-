      We're lowly employees who can barely make our way through such documents, 
      and whose only role in your affair is to stand guard over you ten hours a day 
      and get paid for it. That's all we are, but we're smart enough to realize that 
      before ordering such an arrest the higher authorities who employ us inform 
      themselves in great detail about the person they're arresting and the grounds 
      for the arrest. There's been no mistake.
